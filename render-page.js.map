You've made it through a pretty intense course. It's not easy. Believe me, I know; I wrote it! It really is an accomplishment and you can feel pretty good about it. If your brain feels like mush, it's because we just opened a firehose of knowledge on it. What's hard about web development is you need to understand a wide variety of topics before you can even take your first steps forward.</p>\\n<p>You are not expected to walk away from this course with 100% proficiency in all the topics we went over. In fact many of these really only serve to give you the vocabulary to be able to Google your questions later.</p>\\n<p>My final advice for you:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Always ask questions</li>\\n<li>Google everything. Then Google it again when you forget it</li>\\n<li>Learn voraciously</li>\\n<li>Don't burn out. If you go too hard for too long, it causes all sorts of problems</li>\\n<li>If something interests you then learn everything you can about it! That's what keeps programming fun, learning fun stuff. Chase your interest around like a butterfly</li>\\n<li>Don't compare yourself to others. You have a perfect knowledge of your shortcomings and an imperfect knowledge of their accomplishments. This usually means you're underestimating yourself and overestimating others</li>\\n<li>Programming is a cylce of feeling like an idiot and feeling like the smartest person alive. Don't let either feeling go to your head</li>\\n<li>Do not underestimate the role of ethics in being in a programmer. Use your power to create for good and to make the world a better place</li>\\n<li>The programming world is one that recently has not been inviting to any one not a white man. If you're a white man, actively seek to make your environment inclusive to people who don't look like you. If you're not a white man, I have no advice for you but know I'm rooting for you. Seek advice from someone wiser than me. In either case, no matter who you are, we make this problem by working on it actively and working toward a better future together.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>Please give this course a star on GitHub if you liked it. It helps make it more visible to others and gives it credibility. <a href=\\\"https://github.com/btholt/intro-to-web-dev-v2\\\">Click here</a> and click the star in the top right.

You need somewhere to host your application that is not your laptop. In theory you could host from your computer but any time you shut down your computer website goes away. That's a problem.</p>\\n<p>Luckily for us there are lots of hosting providers out there. And there are many types of hosting providers too! Today I'll show you just one of those providers but I'll make you aware of different alternatives. Ultimately they're all good options.</p>\\n<p>To be transparent: I work for Microsoft and my job is to help people get into Microsoft's cloud, thus I'm going to show you how to use Microsoft's cloud. No one at Microsoft mandated I had to do it this way; I do because I genuinely believe it's a good options. That being said, Google, Amazon, DigitalOcean, IBM, RedHat, RackSpace, etc. all have great clouds and I invite you to check them out to see if they suit your needs better. Also checkout <a href=\\\"https://frontendmasters.com/courses/full-stack/\\\">Jem Young's course</a> to see the differences between Amazon and DigitalOcean.</p>\\n<p>Okay, so let's get started. <a href=\\\"https://aka.ms/Fqk7b0\\\">Click here</a>. You need either a valid credit card and a valid phone number. This is free so even though you verify with your credit card, you will not be charged unless you later change it to a non-free account. I believe it does a \\\"verification hold\\\" of $1.00 to make sure it's a real card. Again, it'll never charge without your consent. You have to convert it to a non-free account.</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>Click sign up for a free account</li>\\n<li>Fill out all the sign up info</li>\\n<li>When prompted, click go to the portal</li>\\n<li>Feel free to do the tour. It takes a minute or so</li>\\n<li>In the side bar, click App Services. App Services is the cloud option for deploying web applications from Microsoft. What's cool about it is that it automatically manages the scaling for you. What that means is that if you website gets really popular, it'll spin up more servers for you and you don't have to do anything. It just does it for you. Once the popularity dies down, it'll spin it back down to one server for you</li>\\n<li>Click create app service</li>\\n<li>Click Web App. If you don't see it, search for it. There are other types of apps you can do, but we're going to do an empty web app we're going to conenct to GitHub.</li>\\n<li>\\n<p>Click the Create button</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>Name your app. I'm calling mine <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">intro-to-web-dev</code>. You will have to call it something else because I took that name. :D</li>\\n<li>Leave it under the free trial subscription</li>\\n<li>Create a new resource group. Microsoft has a lot cloud services like AI, databases, analtyics, etc. You can group these resources together so you can manage them together into a resource group. This will be our only resource in this resource group, so feel free to leave the name the same.</li>\\n<li>Feel free to leave Application Insight off. It is helpful to debug but we're keeping this simple for now</li>\\n<li>Check pin to dashboard</li>\\n<li>Click Create</li>\\n<li>Wait for the deployment to create.

Specifically you need the <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">start</code> part of <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">scripts</code>. This is how Azure knows what to do after it finishes running <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">npm install</code>.</li>\\n<li>When running on a server (often referred to as <strong>running in production</strong>) you need to listen on port 80. Luckily your server will pass this information to you via a special variable, <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">process.env.PORT</code>. <a href=\\\"https://github.com/btholt-test/intro-to-web-dev/blob/e3a9ffc2af005b9e6ffec72e442b32ccf1a261d0/server.js#L37-L39\\\">See here</a> how I did it.</li>\\n<li>Choose the correct branch which is probably master</li>\\n</ol>\\n</li>\\n<li>Wait for your app to deploy. Eventually your website will be visible at <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">http://&lt;your websitename&gt;.azurewbsites.net</code>.</li>\\n</ol>\\n<p>Seems like a lot of steps. And it is. But what's cool is that after you've done this, any time you push new code to your GitHub repository's master branch it will automatically redeploy your app!

Historically this has been the purpose of JavaScript: make websites interactive. However as time has gone by people have really embraced JavaScript as a language. An enterprising individual named Ryan Dahl wrote a connecting layer between Google Chrome's v8 engine, which is what actually runs JavaScript inside of Chrome, and the system. He called it Node.js (often just called Node) and the community just exploded with popularity.</p>\\n<p>You should have installed Node in our previous lesson. If you haven't, <a href=\\\"https://nodejs.org/\\\">do so here</a>.</p>\\n<p>Parcel, the bundler tool used in the previous lesson, is written using Node. Node lets us execute JavaScript outside of the browser. In that case, it's using JavaScript to write a tool that bundles together the code we write so we can serve it to a user. We're going to use it write server code. Going back to our house example from earlier, we're going to create our own pizza place that will respond to all the houses/clients that request pizza/data. It's important to keep that relationship in mind: one server serves many clients, even if in this case we're just going to be serving ourselves.</p>\\n<p>The most basic server in Node is only couple of lines. Let's give it a shot. Start a new project, and add a file called server.js.</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-js\\\"><code class=\\\"language-js\\\"><span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">const</span> http <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">=</span> <span class=\\\"token function\\\">require</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token string\\\">\\\"http\\\"</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n\\n<span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">const</span> server <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">=</span> http<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span><span class=\\\"token function\\\">createServer</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">function</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span>req<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span> res<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span>\\n  console<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span><span class=\\\"token function\\\">log</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token template-string\\\"><span class=\\\"token string\\\">`user visited </span><span class=\\\"token interpolation\\\"><span class=\\\"token interpolation-punctuation punctuation\\\">${</span>req<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span>url<span class=\\\"token interpolation-punctuation punctuation\\\">}</span></span><span class=\\\"token string\\\">`</span></span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n  res<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span><span class=\\\"token function\\\">end</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token string\\\">\\\"hello!\\\"</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n\\nconsole<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span><span class=\\\"token function\\\">log</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token string\\\">\\\"listening on http://localhost:3000\\\"</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\nserver<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span><span class=\\\"token function\\\">listen</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token number\\\">3000</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span></code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>Go to your terminal and run <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">node server.js</code>.

If you went to <a href=\\\"http://localhost:3000/lol\\\">http://localhost:3000/lol</a> then you'd see <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">/lol</code> there (you can actually try that if you want to.)

In our case we're not serving an image for that (it's also just seeing the <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">hello!</code> text) so nothing is displayed there.</p>\\n<p>So let's unpack our Node server a bit more.</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Node is all still using CommonJS for its modules (the old of doing it that we refactored before.) That's why we're using <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">require</code>.</li>\\n<li>We require in the <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">http</code> module which is a module baked into Node. This is the module that we use to do all the necessary communication to be able to run a web server. Think of this like the phone at the pizza place. It allows to listen to requests and then respond to them.</li>\\n<li>The <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">http.createServer</code> method does exactly what you think it does: it creates a server! It takes a function as a callback and this function will be run every time a user makes a request to that server.</li>\\n<li>\\n<p>The function has two parameters: <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">req</code> (request) and <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">res</code> (response).</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>The <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">req</code> parameter represents all the information coming from the user. You can see what URL they used to request, what parameters they sent you, what headers (headers are meta data that your browser sends with each request, like if you want the response to be in English, Spanish, etc.) they used, etc.</li>\\n<li>The <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">res</code> paramenters represents what you want to send back for the request. Here you can set your own headers, set cookies (cookies are bits of information that the client and server pass back-and-forth to each other so you can keep track of who the client is,) the HTTP status code (404 is a status code that means not found; there are many like 200, 302, 403, 500, etc.), and what the response body should be.</li>\\n<li><code class=\\\"language-text\\\">res.end()</code> has to be called at then to let the server know you're done. Since you <em>could</em> do asynchronous things before you respond, it requires you to let it know \\\"yes, I'm done now\\\". If you give <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">end</code> text, it'll respond to the user with that.</li>\\n<li><code class=\\\"language-text\\\">server.listen</code> is how you tell the server to actually start up and start listening for requests. <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">3000</code> represents the port we're listening in. Remember how Parcel listens on 1234? We chose to listen on 3000. It doesn't matter what number we choose (as long as you're above 1024, the explanation is pretty boring and technical; <a href=\\\"https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/16564/why-are-the-first-1024-ports-restricted-to-the-root-user-only\\\">see here</a>)</li>\\n</ul>\\n</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>Cool! This is a pretty boring server. Let's make it more interesting. Working with the <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">http</code> module directly can be a bit tedious and reinventing the wheel. It's very low-level. There are some frameworks built on top of it that make it a lot easier to deal with. We're going to teach you one called <a href=\\\"https://expressjs.com/\\\">Express</a> that makes it a lot easier to work with without being too complicated.</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>In the folder where you made server.js, run <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">npm init -y</code> to generate your package.json</li>\\n<li>Run <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">npm install express</code></li>\\n<li>Change your server to look like this</li>\\n</ol>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-js\\\"><code class=\\\"language-js\\\"><span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">const</span> express <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">=</span> <span class=\\\"token function\\\">require</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token string\\\">\\\"express\\\"</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n\\n<span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">const</span> app <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">=</span> <span class=\\\"token function\\\">express</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n\\napp<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span><span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">get</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token string\\\">\\\"/\\\"</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span> <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">function</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span>req<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span> res<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span>\\n  res<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span><span class=\\\"token function\\\">end</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token string\\\">\\\"Welcome to my site!\\\"</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n\\napp<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span><span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">get</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token string\\\">\\\"/complement\\\"</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span> <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">function</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span>req<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span> res<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span>\\n  res<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span><span class=\\\"token function\\\">end</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token string\\\">\\\"You look nice today\\\"</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n\\napp<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span><span class=\\\"token function\\\">listen</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token number\\\">3000</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\nconsole<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span><span class=\\\"token function\\\">log</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token string\\\">\\\"listening on http://localhost:3000\\\"</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span></code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>Looks pretty similar, right? Express is pretty thin (doesn't do <em>too</em> much) which is great. Let's break it down.</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><code class=\\\"language-text\\\">const app = express();</code> is how you create a new server.</li>\\n<li><code class=\\\"language-text\\\">app.get(url, callback);</code> is how you handle a new route. A route is how you handle you the request when a user hits a particular URL. In this case we set up two, the default home page, <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">/</code>, and <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">/complement</code>. Try visiting both <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">http://localhost:3000</code> and <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">http://localhost:3000/complement</code>. If you try a different URL from those, it'll give a 404 not found error.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>Otherwise it's pretty similar, right? Let's go one step further and make it serve a front end.

A bit here but let's work it out!</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>The <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">getRandomComplement</code> function returns a random item from the <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">complements</code> array. <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">Math.random()</code> gives you random number between 0 and 1. We take that and multiply that by how long the <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">complements</code> array is (which is cool because we can add and subtract items from the <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">complements</code> array and not change this function). This is basically the same as saying we're going take a 0%-100% randomly of the array length. We'll end up with a number like <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">2.16231583252359</code>. We need that to be a whole number so it's a useful index, so we say <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">Math.floor()</code> which gives us that number rounding down, so <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">Math.floor(3.9)</code> is 3 (there's also <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">Math.ceil</code> to round up and <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">Math.round</code> to round how we normally do.) The result is we get a random number between 0 (the first element of an element array) and <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">complements.length - 1</code> (the last element of the array). We then use that to return a random element from <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">complements</code>!</li>\\n<li><code class=\\\"language-text\\\">res.sendFile(path.join(__dirname, &quot;index.html&quot;));</code> sends the user the <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">index.html</code> we just created. <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">path</code> is a libray for getting correct file locations. In this case, we're getting the whole path to it so Express can find it. <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">__dirname</code> is a special Node variable that's the folder of where the server.js file is. We know that index.html is in the same folder, so we're saying serve the index.html file found in the same directory as server.js.</li>\\n<li><code class=\\\"language-text\\\">res.json({ complement: getRandomComplement() }).end();</code> - This is going to respond to the request with a <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">JSON</code> object, just like dog.ceo was doing. It's going to be a small object with just one key: <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">complement</code>. The value to that key is going to be one of the random complements generated by that function.</li>\\n<li><code class=\\\"language-text\\\">app.use(&quot;/public&quot;, express.static(&quot;./public&quot;));</code> serves everything in the public directory publicly. We'll put stuff in here like images, client JS files, CSS files, and anything else we need users to be able to download from our server. Part of what this does is set all the correct headers which you need to do. The browser will request a resource like <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">my-styles.css</code> but the browser needs to know how to read that file: is it an image or is it a CSS file? (it doesn't look at the file extension). It then serves everything inside it from the path on the server <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">/public</code>. We happened to call the folder and the path from the server the same thing but you don't have to (though it's smart to.)</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>That's it!

This will add new files, remove old files, delete some lines in some files, and add lines in others.</p>\\n<p>So let's make our first commit in this repository.</p>\\n<h3 id=\\\"git-add\\\"><a href=\\\"#git-add\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a>git add</h3>\\n<p>The way you add files to a commit is that they have to go through two stages: being staged and then being committed.

GitHub is a centralized repository for git projects. It allows strangers across the world to collaborate on code and make cool stuff. It has become the modern developer's résumé. The code for this website is hosted on <a href=\\\"https://github.com/btholt/intro-to-web-dev-v2\\\">GitHub</a> (feel free to star it if you're there!)</p>\\n<p>Many companies host their code there for all their various open and closed source projects. It's a cool way to browse other people's code and see how they do things. If you see a mistake, you can <strong>fork</strong> their code, which means make your own copy of and fix it yourself. Once fixed, you can open a <strong>pull request</strong> against it. A pull request (often abbreviated as <strong>PR</strong>) is a request for them to merge your commits in with theirs. They will then decide if they want to (since it's their repo) and will merge it or not.</p>\\n<p>Today, we're going to create our own repo.</p>\\n<p>\\n  <a\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-link\\\"\\n    href=\\\"/intro-to-web-dev-v2/static/gh-nav-a672554807ec7d774ac0d81789d76736-90b8e.png\\\"\\n    style=\\\"display: block\\\"\\n    target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\n    rel=\\\"noopener\\\"\\n  >\\n  \\n  <span\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\\\"\\n    style=\\\"position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 650px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\\\"\\n  >\\n    <span\\n      class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\\\"\\n      style=\\\"padding-bottom: 12.822966507177034%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABQAAAADCAYAAACTWi8uAAAACXBIWXMAAAsSAAALEgHS3X78AAAAg0lEQVQI15XIwQqCQABFUf+sRYswmzRHJjP8vpxmCld9UKVmiyJIijY3Ww616cHhwvPUIidJl4RSOcZiRpSkTEJJJOcEfaXKCKYxYawYDEeOTAhy38fTZoOx2y+fX6/tT4W2rLRxlIVmpwu8y/XGv7t3HftjTdW01KeWQ9X0PfN4vngDX6uwU6Nisd0AAAAASUVORK5CYII='); background-size: cover; display: block;\\\"\\n    >\\n      <img\\n        class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-image\\\"\\n        style=\\\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\\\"\\n        alt=\\\"GitHub nav-bar demonstrating where the + symbol is to create a new repo\\\"\\n        title=\\\"\\\"\\n        src=\\\"/intro-to-web-dev-v2/static/gh-nav-a672554807ec7d774ac0d81789d76736-10273.png\\\"\\n        srcset=\\\"/intro-to-web-dev-v2/static/gh-nav-a672554807ec7d774ac0d81789d76736-9b14a.png 163w,\\n/intro-to-web-dev-v2/static/gh-nav-a672554807ec7d774ac0d81789d76736-94962.png 325w,\\n/intro-to-web-dev-v2/static/gh-nav-a672554807ec7d774ac0d81789d76736-10273.png 650w,\\n/intro-to-web-dev-v2/static/gh-nav-a672554807ec7d774ac0d81789d76736-2fc6f.png 975w,\\n/intro-to-web-dev-v2/static/gh-nav-a672554807ec7d774ac0d81789d76736-a8a2c.png 1300w,\\n/intro-to-web-dev-v2/static/gh-nav-a672554807ec7d774ac0d81789d76736-173d2.png 1950w,\\n/intro-to-web-dev-v2/static/gh-nav-a672554807ec7d774ac0d81789d76736-90b8e.png 2090w\\\"\\n        sizes=\\\"(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px\\\"\\n      />\\n    </span>\\n  </span>\\n  \\n  </a>\\n    </p>\\n<p>Click the + (which I highlighted in red for you) in the nav and create a new repository.

Git can be used in a more decentralized way; you could have a remote that's your buddy's computer. But I've never worked that way. We called the remote \\\"origin\\\" but we could have called it anything. But everyone calls it origin. \\\"origin\\\" should always be called where <em>your</em> repo is.

We get to stand the shoulders of giants.</p>\\n<p>Open a new project, put this in the index.html:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-htm\\\"><code class=\\\"language-htm\\\">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;\\n&lt;html lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;\\n\\n&lt;head&gt;\\n  &lt;title&gt;Animation&lt;/title&gt;\\n  &lt;link href=&quot;./animation.css&quot; rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; type=&quot;text/css&quot; /&gt;\\n&lt;/head&gt;\\n\\n&lt;body&gt;\\n  &lt;h1&gt;Animation&lt;/h1&gt;\\n  &lt;div class=&quot;box&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\\n\\n  &lt;script src=&quot;https://unpkg.com/popmotion@8.1.24/dist/popmotion.global.min.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\\n  &lt;script src=&quot;./animation.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\\n&lt;/body&gt;\\n\\n&lt;/html&gt;</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>The order of the script tags is important. The first one is a compressed version of the library that makes it available for us to use in animation.js (which we're about write.) If you don't put it first, then it won't be available for us to use.</p>\\n<p>Make a new CSS file, put:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-css\\\"><code

how PopMotion works and it's more important that you understand how we got it on the page to be interacted with. Notice that we're using this <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">popmotion</code> object. This is being injected into the page by that script we loaded before ours in the HTML. This makes it so we can use it in our script.</p>\\n<p>The code we put there uses the PopMotion library to make it so you can drag-and-drop the blue ball and it'll spring back to its place using realistic physics. Really cool, right? This is not something the browser knows how to do natively, but using JavaScript it can! If you want to play more with PopMotion, <a href=\\\"https://popmotion.io/\\\">see their docs</a>.</p>\\n<p>So this is the quick and easy way to integrate a library. An average website will have at least ten and as many as hundreds of these dependencies. It's not feasible to put all those script tags in your HTML. There is a better way!</p>\\n<h2 id=\\\"building-your-code\\\"><a href=\\\"#building-your-code\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a>Building Your Code</h2>\\n<p>If you haven't, <a href=\\\"https://nodejs.org/\\\">install Node.js</a>. I have Node 10.1.0 installed but any version over 8 should work fine. Node is a program that allows you to run JavaScript from the terminal. You can run web servers with it (which we will at the end) or build really cool tools. We're going to build one our project using one of the cool tools.</p>\\n<p>Once you have Node installed, head to your terminal. When you installed Node, you also will have gotten a tool called <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">npm</code>. <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">npm</code> does <em>not</em> stand for Node Package Manager, so they say … but yeah I think it totally does. Anyway, that's what it does. It manages JavaScript packages. What it allows you do is install things from npm registry. Let's try. Run the following:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-bash\\\"><code class=\\\"language-bash\\\"><span class=\\\"token function\\\">npm</span> <span class=\\\"token function\\\">install</span> --global parcel-bundler</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>It's going to install a bunch of stuff for you so you can then use the tool <a href=\\\"https://parceljs.org/\\\">parcel</a>. Parcel is a tool that makes it super simple to bundle all of you code together into one neat little package. You can also install whatever you want from npm and include that too! From there:</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>Okay, go to your index.html and delete the <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">&lt;script src=&quot;https://unpkg.com/popmotion@8.1.24/dist/popmotion.global.min.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code> line.</li>\\n<li>Go to your animation.js file and add to the top of the file as the very first line: <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">const popmotion = require(&quot;popmotion&quot;);</code>. This will tell the bundler to bring in PopMotion for you.</li>\\n<li>Navigate in your terminal to the root of your animation project. Run <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">npm init -y</code>. This will generate a <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">package.json</code> file for you which is how Node projects handle their configurations. We need to be able to keep track of dependencies and this will do that.</li>\\n<li>Run <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">npm install popmotion</code>. This will install PopMotion locally on your computer instead of loading it from somewhere else. Now your users will download just one file from you instead one file from you and one file from another server. Notice in your animation project there's now a <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">node_modules</code> directory: this is where all you installed dependencies (which is what you call the libraries you install from npm) go.</li>\\n<li>Run <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">parcel index.html</code>. It should tell you that a server is running at <a href=\\\"http://localhost:1234\\\">http://localhost:1234</a> and it'll tell you it took like 8 seconds to bundle everything for you.</li>\\n</ol>\\n<p>Now you'll have a local development server working for you! Open that localhost link and see your same site running. localhost is alias for your own computer that the browser understands. The <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">:1234</code> is the port it's running on. Think of it like selecting the right input on your TV. If you plug your XBox into HDMI3, you have tune your TV to HDMI3 in order to see the picture and hear the sound. Same thing with ports. You computer has thousands of them, you just have to tune to the right one to connect to it.</p>\\n<p>It may be confusing how Parcel knows how to put everything together. We pointed Parcel to the entry point, our HTML file. Our HTML points at both the CSS file and the JS file via a <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">link</code> tag and a <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">script</code> tag respectively. It then follows these and bundle those up for you. It then makes those into pieces that your browser can understand. If you want to, you could make another file and require that too. If you made a file called \\\"rotate-animation.js\\\", you could use the <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">require</code> function at the top of your file and bring that in too. You'd just put <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">const rotateAnimation = require(&#39;./rotate-animation&#39;);</code> and it'd bring in that too. You need the <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">./</code> or Parcel assumes you mean a Node module (like PopMotion is) instead of a file you wrote. And Node assumes you mean <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">.js</code> so you can leave it off (you can also include it if you want to.)</p>\\n<p><code class=\\\"language-text\\\">require(&#39;module-name&#39;)</code> is the old way of doing module imports. The new way uses <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">import</code> instead (there are a slew of reasons that we won't get into now.) New browser-oriented code should be written in this new way. <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/holtbt/status/995528779085721602\\\">Luckily VSCode</a> can automatically refactor it for you.

AJAX is one of the worst offenders of this because it actually means something different than what it does. It stands for \\\"asynchronous JavaScript and XML\\\" which is not what it does. However it morphed and evolved and now it's the term that we use to represent what you do when a website requests more information from a server after the page has loaded.</p>\\n<p>We're going to use AJAX to request data from an API (lol acronyms.) An API is application programming interface, but what we mean we say API in this context is it's a public server that will allow us to make AJAX calls and it will respond. Most big websites will have some sort of public API, like Twitter for example. There are many <a href=\\\"https://github.com/toddmotto/public-apis\\\">public APIs</a>.</p>\\n<p>The API we're going to use is <a href=\\\"https://dog.ceo/dog-api/\\\">dog.ceo</a>. It's a simple, silly API that will give you back random pictures of dogs. Awesome. Make a new project in your favorite editor, add an index.html with the following:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-htm\\\"><code class=\\\"language-htm\\\">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;\\n&lt;html lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;\\n\\n&lt;head&gt;\\n  &lt;title&gt;Dogs&lt;/title&gt;\\n&lt;/head&gt;\\n\\n&lt;body&gt;\\n  &lt;h1&gt;Doggos&lt;/h1&gt;\\n  &lt;div class=&quot;doggos&quot;&gt;\\n  &lt;/div&gt;\\n\\n  &lt;script src=&quot;./doggos.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\\n&lt;/body&gt;\\n\\n&lt;/html&gt;</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>Make a new file called <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">doggos.js</code> and put the following:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-js\\\"><code class=\\\"language-js\\\"><span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">const</span> <span class=\\\"token constant\\\">BREEDS_URL</span> <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">=</span> <span class=\\\"token string\\\">\\\"https://dog.ceo/api/breeds/image/random\\\"</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n\\n<span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">const</span> promise <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">=</span> <span class=\\\"token function\\\">fetch</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token constant\\\">DOG_URL</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n\\npromise\\n  <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span><span class=\\\"token function\\\">then</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">function</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span>response<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span>\\n    <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">const</span> processingPromise <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">=</span> response<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span><span class=\\\"token function\\\">json</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n    <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">return</span> processingPromise<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span><span class=\\\"token function\\\">then</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">function</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span>processedResponse<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span>\\n    console<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span><span class=\\\"token function\\\">log</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span>breeds<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n\\nconsole<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span><span class=\\\"token function\\\">log</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token string\\\">\\\"this will log first\\\"</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span></code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>We're using a browser function here called <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">fetch</code>. <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">fetch</code> is the new way of doing AJAX and it is so much easier than the old one. Never use the old one. What <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">fetch</code> returns is called a <strong>promise</strong> and it's similar to a callback that we used before. A promise, like callbacks, allows you to deal with things that don't happen immediately, things that are asynchronous. In this case, we're waiting for the API to respond with the information we asked for. It takes to request more information over the Internet and we don't want to hold up the rest of our code.</p>\\n<p>With a promise, it's an object that represents the future answer to whatever you asked. That's sort of weird, but it ends up being convenient. So, we have this promise, and with it we call the <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">then</code> method on it and give it a function to run once that asynchronous action (the API request) finishes.</p>\\n<p>The response will look something like:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-json\\\"><code class=\\\"language-json\\\"><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token property\\\">\\\"status\\\"</span><span class=\\\"token operator\\\">:</span> <span class=\\\"token string\\\">\\\"success\\\"</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token property\\\">\\\"message\\\"</span><span class=\\\"token operator\\\">:</span> <span class=\\\"token string\\\">\\\"https://images.dog.ceo/breeds/affenpinscher/n02110627_11783.jpg\\\"</span>\\n<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span></code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>If that looks like JavaScript it's because it's technically valid JavaScript! It makes it really easy to use with JavaScript. Once it finishes, it gives you back an unuseful blob of stuff though. We know this blob is actually given to us in a special format called <strong>JSON</strong> (lol more acronyms.) JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation, and it's a very common way to exchange data over the Internet because it's machine readable but also pretty readable to humans. Because we know this response will be in JSON (we know that because the <a href=\\\"https://dog.ceo/dog-api/documentation/random\\\">documentation</a> say so) we can say process this blob into a JavaScript object we can use.</p>\\n<p>However processing this into JSON is not always trivial. If you have a lot stuff to process, it can take a lot of time and computer processing to do so. As such, this made asynchronous as well and it returns a promise. That's why we do the <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">return processingPromise;</code> line. This is called <strong>promise chaining</strong>. The next <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">then</code> will be called once this processing is finished.</p>\\n<p>Once finished, it's a normal JavaScript we can access normally. So try (inside of the function with <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">processedResponse</code>): <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">console.log(processedResponse.status)</code>. It should log out <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">&quot;success&quot;</code>. Cool, right?</p>\\n<p>So now what I want to do make an image on the page of a random doggo. This API happens to do just that! So, let's make it happen.

If you're trying to tackle too much at once, break it into two smaller problems and try to solve one of those.</li>\\n<li>Personally, I wrote the HTML and CSS first. Once that's all taken care of, then I do the JavaScript.</li>\\n<li>For the font of the \\\"result screen\\\" I'd just use <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">monospace</code>.</li>\\n<li>There are so many ways to write this. There is no one right way. My solution is not the only nor is it the best solution. Experiment. Try. Fail. Succeed. It's all about learning here.</li>\\n<li>Good idea to use <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">&lt;button&gt;&lt;/button&gt;</code> for the buttons. You have to deal with some extra styling stuff but it will make your code work pretty much automatically for disabled people. In general when writing HTML, if something serves the function of a button, make it a <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">&lt;button&gt;&lt;/button&gt;</code>.</li>\\n<li>I used multiple rows of flex layed out divs for the button. You could do it all in one div using the <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">flex-wrap</code> property.</li>\\n<li>The secret to getting equal gutters (which is what you call the black space between buttons): you can set width to be <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">24.5%</code> (so four of them fit on a line) and then use <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">justify-cotent: space-between</code> to evenly space them. That'll give them a gutter of roughly <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">.5%</code> of the whole width. The problem with using percentages in conjuections with heights: your heights and widths are different. 5% of height is not the same of 5% of width, and that'll make the gutters look weird. You want the bottom gutters to be the same size as the side gutters. <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">margin-bottom</code> to the resuce! If you give the row a <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">margin-bottom</code> of <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">.5%</code> (if you're using my same numbers) then that'll work since margin is always measured as a function of width (just one of those things you have to know!) Hopefully that helps.</li>\\n<li>Sometimes I do the math to get things right. Sometimes I just guess-and-check to see if it looks okay.</li>\\n<li>You can add a class to get the orange buttons. Or you could try <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">:last-child</code> (assuming you have row div.)</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h2 id=\\\"javascript-tips-and-hints\\\"><a href=\\\"#javascript-tips-and-hints\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a>JavaScript Tips and Hints</h2>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Again, no wrong way to do this. I wrote about 80 lines of JavaScript to finish the project (not including empty lines.) I say that so you have an idea of how much code you should be writing. If you're writing 200+ lines of code, you may want to rethink some of your solutions. Don't feel like you're going for the smallest possible answer. You're just going for correct.</li>\\n<li>I use <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">console.log</code> everywhere while I'm writing code. Just remember to take them out at the end.</li>\\n<li>Many small functions is <em>very</em> preferable to one large function. Have each function do one thing well as opposed to having giant functions that do everything. If you find a function doing too, break it into smaller pieces. I solved it with eight different functions.</li>\\n<li>You'll need to keep track of several variables. Make sure these variables are stored in a place where they stay in scope.</li>\\n<li>You can add an event listener to each button individually, or you can use one listener at the root of the button. I did the latter but it's up to you.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h2 id=\\\"types\\\"><a href=\\\"#types\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a>Types</h2>\\n<p>A brief note on what called <strong>types</strong> in JavaScript. We've danced the idea already and I want to make it a little more concrete for you. Strings, booleans, objects, arrays, numbers, these are different types of types (lol). JavaScript is a language where you don't have to concern yourself <em>a lot</em> with types since it doesn't strictly enforce them (other languages do) but in this problem you are definitely going to have to deal with it.</p>\\n<p>Whatever you put into the DOM and whatever you get out it are going to strings, every time. If I do:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"number-target\\\"></div>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-javascript\\\"><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\"><span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">const</span> num <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">=</span> <span class=\\\"token number\\\">10</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n<span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">const</span> div <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">=</span> document<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span><span class=\\\"token function\\\">querySelector</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token string\\\">\\\".number-target\\\"</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span> <span class=\\\"token comment\\\">// the div right above this block</span>\\nconsole<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span><span class=\\\"token function\\\">log</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span>num<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span> <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">typeof</span> num<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span> <span class=\\\"token comment\\\">// this is a number here</span>\\ndiv<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span>innerText <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">=</span> num<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\nconsole<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span><span class=\\\"token function\\\">log</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span>div<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span>innerText<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span> <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">typeof</span> div<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span>innerText<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span> <span class=\\\"token comment\\\">// it's a string here</span></code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>Since you're doing math here, you'll need the numbers to actually be of the number type. Otherwise you'll get <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">&quot;5&quot; + &quot;5&quot; = &quot;55&quot;</code>. There's a function called <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">parseInt(string)</code> that will turn a string of a number (<code class=\\\"language-text\\\">&quot;5&quot;</code>) to a number (<code class=\\\"language-text\\\">5</code>).</p>\\n<p>You'll also see that we used the <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">typeof</code> operator. <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">typeof</code> tells whatever the type of the thing that comes right after it is. This is useful to quickly see what's happening in your code. Be careful because <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">typeof</code> is not always useful, but it is useful for telling numbers and strings apart.</p>\\n<h2 id=\\\"answer\\\"><a href=\\\"#answer\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a>Answer</h2>\\n<ul>\\n<li><a href=\\\"/calculator.html\\\">The HTML</a> (you can view source on it)</li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"/calculator.js\\\">The JavaScript</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"/calculator.css\\\">The CSS</a></li>\\n</ul>\",\"frontmatter\":{\"path\":\"/js-project\",\"title\":\"JavaScript, HTML, and CSS Project\",\"order\":15}},\"allMarkdownRemark\":{\"edges\":[{\"node\":{\"frontmatter\":{\"order\":0,\"path\":\"/intro\",\"title\":\"Introduction to the Course\"}}},{\"node\":{\"frontmatter\":{\"order\":1,\"path\":\"/overview\",\"title\":\"Overview of What You'll Be Learning In This Course\"}}},{\"node\":{\"frontmatter\":{\"order\":2,\"path\":\"/tools\",\"title\":\"Tools\"}}},{\"node\":{\"frontmatter\":{\"order\":3,\"path\":\"/basic-html\",\"title\":\"Basic HTML\"}}},{\"node\":{\"frontmatter\":{\"order\":4,\"path\":\"/html-next-steps\",\"title\":\"HTML Next Steps\"}}},{\"node\":{\"frontmatter\":{\"order\":5,\"path\":\"/meta-html\",\"title\":\"Meta HTML\"}}},{\"node\":{\"frontmatter\":{\"order\":6,\"path\":\"/basic-css\",\"title\":\"Basic CSS\"}}},{\"node\":{\"frontmatter\":{\"order\":7,\"path\":\"/selectors\",\"title\":\"CSS Selectors and the Cascade\"}}},{\"node\":{\"frontmatter\":{\"order\":8,\"path\":\"/layout-css\",\"title\":\"Layout CSS\"}}},{\"node\":{\"frontmatter\":{\"order\":9,\"path\":\"/css-patterns\",\"title\":\"Effective Patterns for Writing CSS\"}}},{\"node\":{\"frontmatter\":{\"order\":10,\"path\":\"/project-html-css\",\"title\":\"Project: HTML & CSS\"}}},{\"node\":{\"frontmatter\":{\"order\":11,\"path\":\"/programming-fundamentals\",\"title\":\"Programming Fundamentals\"}}},{\"node\":{\"frontmatter\":{\"order\":12,\"path\":\"/functions-and-scope\",\"title\":\"Functions and Scope\"}}},{\"node\":{\"frontmatter\":{\"order\":13,\"path\":\"/objects-and-arrays\",\"title\":\"Objects and Arrays\"}}},{\"node\":{\"frontmatter\":{\"order\":14,\"path\":\"/dom\",\"title\":\"The DOM\"}}},{\"node\":{\"frontmatter\":{\"order\":15,\"path\":\"/js-project\",\"title\":\"JavaScript, HTML, and CSS Project\"}}},{\"node\":{\"frontmatter\":{\"order\":16,\"path\":\"/ajax\",\"title\":\"AJAX\"}}},{\"node\":{\"frontmatter\":{\"order\":17,\"path\":\"/libraries\",\"title\":\"Integrating with Other People's Libraries\"}}},{\"node\":{\"frontmatter\":{\"order\":18,\"path\":\"/git-and-bash\",\"title\":\"Git and Bash\"}}},{\"node\":{\"frontmatter\":{\"order\":19,\"path\":\"/node\",\"title\":\"Node.js\"}}},{\"node\":{\"frontmatter\":{\"order\":20,\"path\":\"/deploying\",\"title\":\"Deploying Your App\"}}},{\"node\":{\"frontmatter\":{\"order\":21,\"path\":\"/final-thoughts\",\"title\":\"Final Thoughts\"}}}]}},\"pathContext\":{}}\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./.cache/json/js-project.json\n// module id = 466\n// module chunks = 0","module.exports = {\"data\":{\"markdownRemark\":{\"html\":\"<p>So far we've been writing code pretty well in a vacuum.

Now we're going to start using JavaScript to interact with your webpage.</p>\\n<p>Let's first chat about what a browser is and how your code gets from you writing it to being on run in a browser.</p>\\n<p>In a typical circumstance.</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>You write code in your editor (like VSCode)</li>\\n<li>You put your code on a server so that other people can get it</li>\\n<li>\\n<p>Someone visits your website</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>(Lots of stuff happens here.

So how are we doing it locally, without a server, just on our computers? Your computer is basically faking this process. It's acting as both the server and the client so that it's easier for you to write code. When you open a file in your browser from your computer, your hard drive is the server. This was a point of confusion for me when starting so I'm sharing it with you.</p>\\n<p>Okay, now we've gotten that out of the way, let's begin making another project.</p>\\n<h2 id=\\\"the-dom\\\"><a href=\\\"#the-dom\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a>The DOM</h2>\\n<p>The way that JavaScript and HTML/CSS interact with each other is a thing called the DOM, the document object model. The DOM is basically a bunch of objects and methods that you can call from JavaScript to interact with the HTML/CSS of the page.</p>\\n<p>Note: here we're going to use the <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">script</code> tag and put the JavaScript directly inside of it so we can keep all the code together for these small examples. This not something you'd typically do (just like you'd normally separate the CSS from the HTML too.) It is possible but not recommended.</p>\\n<p>Let's see an example:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-html\\\"><code class=\\\"language-html\\\"><span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">&lt;</span>style</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">></span></span><span class=\\\"token style language-css\\\">\\n  <span class=\\\"token selector\\\">.red-square</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span>\\n    <span class=\\\"token property\\\">width</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">:</span> 100px<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n    <span class=\\\"token property\\\">height</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">:</span> 100px<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n    <span class=\\\"token property\\\">background-color</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">:</span> crimson<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span>\\n</span><span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">&lt;/</span>style</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">></span></span>\\n\\n<span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">&lt;</span>div</span> <span class=\\\"token attr-name\\\">class</span><span class=\\\"token attr-value\\\"><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">=</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">\\\"</span>red-square<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">\\\"</span></span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">></span></span><span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">&lt;/</span>div</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">></span></span>\\n\\n<span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">&lt;</span>script</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">></span></span><span class=\\\"token script language-javascript\\\">\\n  <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">const</span> redSquare <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">=</span> document<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span><span class=\\\"token function\\\">querySelector</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token string\\\">'.red-square'</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n  redSquare<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span>style<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span>backgroundColor <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">=</span> <span class=\\\"token string\\\">'limegreen'</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n</span><span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">&lt;/</span>script</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">></span></span></code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>Notice that, despite the CSS class dicatating that the <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">div</code> should be <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">crimson</code> colored, it's actually <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">limegreen</code>. This is because we used JavaScript to change the color of it. So let's break it down.</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>We called a method on <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">document</code>. <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">document</code> is a globally available variable in the browser that you use to interact with the HTML and CSS. It a lot of methods that you can use. In this case, we're using the <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">querySelector</code> in which you pass in a CSS selector and it returns to you the <strong>first</strong> one of that matches selector that it finds (if you have many of them on the page, you get just the first one.)</li>\\n<li>From there, we have a JavaScript pointer to the <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">div.red-square</code> tag stored in the <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">redSquare</code> variable which means we can start manipulating it.</li>\\n<li>We then use the <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">style</code> object which represents all the CSS styles that are being applied to that object at that time.</li>\\n<li>We then set the <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">backgroundColor</code> of that element. Notice it is <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">backgroundColor</code> and not <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">background-color</code> (camelCasing vs kebab-casing). This is how you interact with CSS via JavaScript. Anything that's kebab-cased like <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">padding-right</code> becomes camelCased, like <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">paddingRight</code>. While annoying, it'd be even more annoying if they didn't switch it since everything in JavaScript is camelCased.</li>\\n<li>We then just assign that to be whatever value we want. This works with any CSS property, eg: <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">tag.style.marginBottom = &#39;50px&#39;</code>.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>There's a lot more you can do with an element than just modifying its style. You can add more HTML into it, remove it, change the text, search for different elements inside of it, get its position on the page, clone it, and a lot more.</p>\\n<p>Okay, so what if we had multiple elements we wanted to modify all at once. We have the tools to do that too!</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-html\\\"><code class=\\\"language-html\\\"><span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span

using <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">document</code>. Awesome! We're going to go one step further and start involving the user. Web sites are meant to be reactive to users. In order to be reactive to them, we need to wait for them to do stuff, like click a button or type in an input. The way we do that is we wait for <strong>events</strong> to happen. An event is created every time certain events happens like when a user clicks something or when they type something. We respond to these events by having what are called <strong>event listeners</strong>. We give an event listener a function to run whenever an event happens. Let's take a look at responding to a click when a user clicks a button.</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-html\\\"><code class=\\\"language-html\\\"><span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">&lt;</span>button</span> <span class=\\\"token attr-name\\\">class</span><span class=\\\"token attr-value\\\"><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">=</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">\\\"</span>event-button<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">\\\"</span></span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">></span></span>Click me!<span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">&lt;/</span>button</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">></span></span>\\n<span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">&lt;</span>script</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">></span></span>\\n  const button = document.querySelector('.event-button');\\n  button.addEventListener('click', function () {\\n    alert(\\\"Hey there!\\\");\\n  });</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>Let's break it down.</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>We grab the button via <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">querySelector</code> and store it in the JavaScript variable <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">button</code>.</li>\\n<li>We then call the <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">addEventListener</code> method on the button. This takes two parameters (no need to memorize this, you can always look it up): the name of the event you want respond to, which in this case is the <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">click</code> event, and a function that is called whenever that event happens. This function is often called a <strong>callback</strong> because it gets called back whenever the event happens.</li>\\n<li>We then call a function called <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">alert</code>. <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">alert</code> is a super, super annoying function that pops up a dialog window with whatever you call it with.</li>\\n<li>People often get confused seeing <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">});</code> on the last line. The first <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">}</code> is closing the function, the second <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">)</code> is closing the function call of <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">addEventListener</code>, and the <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">;</code> ends the statement.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>Let's do another example with an <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">input</code> tag.</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-html\\\"><code class=\\\"language-html\\\"><span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">&lt;</span>input</span> <span class=\\\"token attr-name\\\">placeholder</span><span class=\\\"token attr-value\\\"><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">=</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">\\\"</span>type into me!<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">\\\"</span></span> <span class=\\\"token attr-name\\\">class</span><span class=\\\"token attr-value\\\"><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">=</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">\\\"</span>input-to-copy<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">\\\"</span></span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">/></span></span>\\n<span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">&lt;</span>p</span> <span class=\\\"token attr-name\\\">class</span><span class=\\\"token attr-value\\\"><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">=</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">\\\"</span>p-to-copy-to<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">\\\"</span></span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">></span></span>Nothing has happened yet.<span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">&lt;/</span>p</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">></span></span>\\n<span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">&lt;</span>script</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">></span></span><span class=\\\"token script language-javascript\\\">\\n  <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">const</span> input <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">=</span> document<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span><span class=\\\"token function\\\">querySelector</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token string\\\">'.input-to-copy'</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">const</span> paragraph <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">=</span> document<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span><span class=\\\"token function\\\">querySelector</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token string\\\">'.p-to-copy-to'</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n\\n  input<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span><span class=\\\"token function\\\">addEventListener</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token string\\\">\\\"keyup\\\"</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span> <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">function</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span>\\n    paragraph<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span>innerText  <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">=</span> input<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span>value<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n</span><span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">&lt;/</span>script</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">></span></span></code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>Try typing into the input.

Pretty cool, right?</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>We're now using the <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">keyup</code> event. This event happens whenever you release a key after pressing it. As you may guess, there is a <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">keydown</code> event too that is fired whenver you press a key. We're using <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">keyup</code> because <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">keydown</code> happens <em>before</em> a key actually registers which means we would always be one key behind.</li>\\n<li>We're reference <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">input.value</code>.

Then, when we click the button, we're using the <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">event</code> parameter that is being passed into the callback. You may be wondering where that came from. It was always there, we just ignoring it. An event listener's first parameter is always an event object. There's lots of information on the event object but we're most concerned with <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">event.target</code>. <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">target</code> is the tag that the event originated from. In this case it'll be the button that caused the event. And we know that with tags you can use the <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">innerText</code> property to get the text inside of them. That's how we able to alert the correct number.

This is a strange, complicated, and difficult concept in JavaScript known as context and trips up all sorts of people, new and old to the language. If you decide to pursue a career as a developer, interviewers will often ask questions about context in JavaScript. It's worth investment to understand how it works.</p>\\n<p>In the simplest form, anywhere you are in JavaScript you have a context you are in. You can reference that context by using <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">this</code>. If I just reference <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">this</code> from the outtermost layer, it'll be the global object, which in the browser is something called <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">window</code>. <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">window</code> already has a bunch of stuff on it. For example:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-javascript\\\"><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\">console<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span><span class=\\\"token function\\\">log</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">this</span> <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">===</span> window<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\nconsole<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span><span class=\\\"token function\\\">log</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">this</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span>scrollY<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\nconsole<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span><span class=\\\"token function\\\">log</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span>window<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span>scrollY<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span></code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>As you can see from the first line, you can see that in this context, window is the <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">this</code> at that time. However, in the example above when we're doing the address, the <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">this</code> is the object since when I <strong>call the function</strong>, it's created inside of an object. That object then becomes <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">this</code> when <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">getAddress</code> is called. As soon as the function completes, the context is destroyed and the context goes back to being what it was before, in this case <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">window</code>.</p>\\n<p>A good rule of thumb (that is unfortunately not always true) is that if you're inside an object of some sort, the <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">this</code> will be that object. If not, it'll be the global object, <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">window</code>. There are crazy exceptions to this and you can even manipulate it yourself. For now, operate with that definition.

Inside of an array, you can store anything you can store in a variable. You can have an array of numbers, an arry of strings, an array of objects, an array of arrays, an array of arrays of arrays, etc.</p>\\n<p>You can also see above how we access individual elements in an array: we use square brackets again and then we reference the number that we want to access. Again, remember, the numbering starts at 0. So the first element is index 0.</p>\\n<p>Arrays also have many methods (another word for functions that live on an object) and properties (another word for key/value pairs) that live on them. Let's see some of those:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-javascript\\\"><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\"><span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">const</span> primeNumbers <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">=</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">[</span><span class=\\\"token number\\\">1</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span> <span class=\\\"token number\\\">2</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span> <span class=\\\"token number\\\">3</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span> <span class=\\\"token number\\\">5</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span> <span class=\\\"token number\\\">7</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span> <span class=\\\"token number\\\">11</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span> <span class=\\\"token number\\\">13</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span> <span class=\\\"token number\\\">17</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">]</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\nconsole<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span><span class=\\\"token function\\\">log</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span>primeNumbers<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span>length<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\nconsole<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span><span class=\\\"token function\\\">log</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span>primeNumbers<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span><span class=\\\"token function\\\">join</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token string\\\">\\\" | \\\"</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span></code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p><code class=\\\"language-text\\\">primeNumbers.length</code> gives you back an number that is how long the array is. In this case there are eight elements in the array so it gives us back <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">8</code>. <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">primeNumbers.join(&quot; | &quot;))</code> takes your whole array and makes it into one string.

We use that <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">i</code> to access each item in the array on each iteration of the loop. We have the loop stop when <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">i</code> gets equal to the <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">length</code> of cities. Very useful pattern. You'll see it a lot.</p>\\n<p>The second way is using a function that arrays have called <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">forEach</code>. This <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">forEach</code> method takes in a function and that function will be called once on each item of the array. It will pass that item into the function, which is what <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">city</code> is in this situation. Both are useful patterns to know. You'll use both frequently. While you're getting started, just use the one you feel comfortable with. They have different things that make them preferable in different situations but usually you can use either. Method 2 may be a bit more advance but I don't think you should be scared of it.</p>\",\"frontmatter\":{\"path\":\"/objects-and-arrays\",\"title\":\"Objects and Arrays\",\"order\":13}},\"allMarkdownRemark\":{\"edges\":[{\"node\":{\"frontmatter\":{\"order\":0,\"path\":\"/intro\",\"title\":\"Introduction to the Course\"}}},{\"node\":{\"frontmatter\":{\"order\":1,\"path\":\"/overview\",\"title\":\"Overview of What You'll Be Learning In This Course\"}}},{\"node\":{\"frontmatter\":{\"order\":2,\"path\":\"/tools\",\"title\":\"Tools\"}}},{\"node\":{\"frontmatter\":{\"order\":3,\"path\":\"/basic-html\",\"title\":\"Basic HTML\"}}},{\"node\":{\"frontmatter\":{\"order\":4,\"path\":\"/html-next-steps\",\"title\":\"HTML Next Steps\"}}},{\"node\":{\"frontmatter\":{\"order\":5,\"path\":\"/meta-html\",\"title\":\"Meta HTML\"}}},{\"node\":{\"frontmatter\":{\"order\":6,\"path\":\"/basic-css\",\"title\":\"Basic CSS\"}}},{\"node\":{\"frontmatter\":{\"order\":7,\"path\":\"/selectors\",\"title\":\"CSS Selectors and the Cascade\"}}},{\"node\":{\"frontmatter\":{\"order\":8,\"path\":\"/layout-css\",\"title\":\"Layout CSS\"}}},{\"node\":{\"frontmatter\":{\"order\":9,\"path\":\"/css-patterns\",\"title\":\"Effective Patterns for Writing CSS\"}}},{\"node\":{\"frontmatter\":{\"order\":10,\"path\":\"/project-html-css\",\"title\":\"Project: HTML & CSS\"}}},{\"node\":{\"frontmatter\":{\"order\":11,\"path\":\"/programming-fundamentals\",\"title\":\"Programming Fundamentals\"}}},{\"node\":{\"frontmatter\":{\"order\":12,\"path\":\"/functions-and-scope\",\"title\":\"Functions and Scope\"}}},{\"node\":{\"frontmatter\":{\"order\":13,\"path\":\"/objects-and-arrays\",\"title\":\"Objects and Arrays\"}}},{\"node\":{\"frontmatter\":{\"order\":14,\"path\":\"/dom\",\"title\":\"The DOM\"}}},{\"node\":{\"frontmatter\":{\"order\":15,\"path\":\"/js-project\",\"title\":\"JavaScript, HTML, and CSS Project\"}}},{\"node\":{\"frontmatter\":{\"order\":16,\"path\":\"/ajax\",\"title\":\"AJAX\"}}},{\"node\":{\"frontmatter\":{\"order\":17,\"path\":\"/libraries\",\"title\":\"Integrating with Other People's Libraries\"}}},{\"node\":{\"frontmatter\":{\"order\":18,\"path\":\"/git-and-bash\",\"title\":\"Git and Bash\"}}},{\"node\":{\"frontmatter\":{\"order\":19,\"path\":\"/node\",\"title\":\"Node.js\"}}},{\"node\":{\"frontmatter\":{\"order\":20,\"path\":\"/deploying\",\"title\":\"Deploying Your App\"}}},{\"node\":{\"frontmatter\":{\"order\":21,\"path\":\"/final-thoughts\",\"title\":\"Final Thoughts\"}}}]}},\"pathContext\":{}}\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./.cache/json/objects-and-arrays.json\n// module id = 468\n// module chunks = 0","module.exports = {\"data\":{\"markdownRemark\":{\"html\":\"<p>A function is a bit of re-usable code.

Here we use four parameters. The order is important that we send in the parameters because this will be the order function receives these parameters. You can have as many or as few parameters as you like.</p>\\n<p>The way <strong>call</strong> a function is you add parens to the end of it, like this: <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">someFunctionName()</code>. If you see parens after a variable name, you instantly know that that's a function. Inside of the parens go the parameters. These variables will be passed to the function that is being called in the order that you put them there.

For example:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-javascript\\\"><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\"><span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">function</span> <span class=\\\"token function\\\">addFive</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span>number<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">const</span> someVariable <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">=</span> <span class=\\\"token string\\\">\\\"you can't see me outside this function\\\"</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">return</span> number <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">+</span> <span class=\\\"token number\\\">5</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span>\\n\\n<span class=\\\"token function\\\">addFive</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token number\\\">10</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\nconsole<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span><span class=\\\"token function\\\">log</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span>someVariable<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span></code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>This is not going to work. <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">someVariable</code> is inside of the <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">addFive</code> scope and once <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">addFive</code> completes, it throws <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">someVariable</code> away since it's now out-of-scope.</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-javascript\\\"><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\"><span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">let</span> friendsAtYourParty <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">=</span> <span class=\\\"token number\\\">0</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n<span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">for</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">let</span> i <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">=</span> <span class=\\\"token number\\\">0</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span> i <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">&lt;=</span> <span class=\\\"token number\\\">10</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span> i<span class=\\\"token operator\\\">++</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span>\\n  friendsAtYourParty<span class=\\\"token operator\\\">++</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span>\\nconsole<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span><span class=\\\"token function\\\">log</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span>i<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span></code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>Even this doesn't work since <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">i</code> is only in scope for the loop and then after that it's thrown away. This can be a difficult one to deal with as someone new to coding because you'll go to log something or use a variable and it's out of scope so it's not there. Just know if that happens, this is probably the problem.</p>\\n<p>Scope is hard. And scope is particularly strange in JavaScript (it varies by programming language.) If it feels hard it's because it is. A general, imperfect way for you to think about it right now is that a variable is \\\"alive\\\" (in scope) in between whatever the closest <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">{</code> is until that <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">{</code> closes its corresponding <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">}</code>. A few examples below, see if you can get it right. Keep in mind that the variable will stay in scope as long as any scope it exists in still exists. If I declare a variable in an outter scope and modify a variable in an inner scope, that variable will survive as long as the outter scope does. <strong>It matters where the variable is declared.</strong></p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-js\\\"><code class=\\\"language-js\\\"><span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">const</span> <span

Smart people have created this commonly-used functions for things we often need. For example, say you have a string and you want to make everything lowercase, you can do this:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-javascript\\\"><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\"><span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">const</span> sentence <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">=</span> <span class=\\\"token string\\\">\\\"ThIs HaS wEiRd CaSiNg On It\\\"</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\nconsole<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span><span class=\\\"token function\\\">log</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span>sentence<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span><span class=\\\"token function\\\">toLowerCase</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span></code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>Always be looking for the parens. And the best place to look all this stuff up is from our friends at Mozilla (makers of Firefox): <a href=\\\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/\\\">the MDN</a>. MDN used to stand for \\\"Mozilla Developer Network\\\" I think but now it's just synonmous with the documentation for the web. I literally look at this website several times a day. As I said before, you are not expected to remember everything. Looking things up on the MDN is <strong>not</strong> cheating.</p>\\n<p>You can call <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">Math.round(5.1)</code> and it'll return that number rounded (in this, <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">5</code>). You can use <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">string.substr(indexToStart, howManyCharactersToInclude)</code> to return part of a string. For example <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">const name = &quot;Brian Holt&quot;; console.log(name.substr(6, 3))</code> logs out <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">&quot;Hol&quot;</code> (remember numbering starts at 0).

You can think of writing code as essentially writing notes on how to solve a particular problem that just happens to be in a way that computer can understand it.</p>\\n<p>Wait, why? The why is because you or someone else will have to go back and re-read that code some time in the future, maybe tomorrow or maybe in ten years (I've worked on code older than 10 years old, it's not fun.) As such, it's important to write code in a such way that it's easily understandable to someone with little context. You will spend far longer maintaining this code than you will writing it the first time. Be explicit. Be deliberate. The point here is not to be clever but to be simple and to communicate clearly. Code is communication.</p>\\n<p>Okay, given this, let's frame how this code works then. When you write code, the computer breaks it down into smaller pieces it can understand and then executes those one bit at a time. With JavaScript, only one thing is ever happening at a time (this is called being <em>single threaded</em> but that is not a term you need to know.) In general, this means it executes line 1, then line 2, then line 3, etc. Let's that in action:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-javascript\\\"><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\"><span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">const</span> monthlyRent <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">=</span> <span class=\\\"token number\\\">500</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n\\n<span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">const</span> yearlyRent <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">=</span> monthlyRent <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">*</span> <span class=\\\"token number\\\">12</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\nconsole<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span><span class=\\\"token function\\\">log</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span>yearlyRent<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span></code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>The first thing that happens above is that we declare a variable, <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">monthlyRent</code>. The <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">const</code> keyword is how we let JavaScript know we're declaring a variable. Variable names always have to know no spaces in them, which is why we squish the words \\\"monthly rent\\\" together. In order to make this more readable, we use what's called <em>camel casing</em>, so-called because the capital letters in the middle make it look like humps on a camel. You can also use other styles of captialization, there's no rule it must be camel case in JavaScript; everyone just happens to do camel casing in JavaScript.</p>\\n<p>Notice the <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">;</code> at the end of every line. This semi colon lets JavaScript know you've completed your thought. Think of this as the period/full-stop of the the programming world.</p>\\n<p>Variable can be called <em>almost</em> anything. You <strong>can't</strong> use keywords. An example would be <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">const const = 15</code>. <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">const</code> is a keyword so it can't be used as a variable name. You do want to give your variables good names. Imagine we have a huge file and 200 lines below we see the variable named <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">monthlyRent</code>: we'll know instantly what this variable does and we won't have to go try to read the code to figure it out. Always, always, always use good variable names. Seriously. Put time into it. Naming things is hard and it's a big part of your job.</p>\\n<p>Okay, so after line one, I have a variable named <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">monthlyRent</code> that I can use as much as I want. In this case, it represents the number of <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">500</code> but it also semantically represents monthlyRent. Imagine if I had 1000 lines between where <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">monthlyRent</code> is declared and where <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">yearlyRent</code> is calculated. I could have just put <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">500</code> directly in <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">yearlyRent</code> but I don't because I now understand how that's calculated just by reading the code. Use variables. Use them everywhere. It makes your code way easier to read. Also, later, if my monthly rent changes, I can change it one place and everywhere I reference <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">monthlyRent</code> gets updated automatically. Powerful stuff.</p>\\n<p>Okay, I think calculate <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">yearlyRent</code>. I use the <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">*</code> to represent multiplication. I'm also mixing variables and numbers which is just fine. I also could have said <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">const yearlyRent = monthlyRent * monthsInAYear;</code> (assuming I put <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">const monthsInAYear = 12;</code> somewhere else) too and that would be a good idea. I would argue the two are roughly the same since it's obvious there are 12 months in a year. But you do what you think is most clear. That's your job.</p>\\n<p><code class=\\\"language-text\\\">console.log(yearlyRent);</code> is going to print whatever is stored in <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">yearlyRent</code> to the JavaScript console. The JavaScript Console is a part of the dev tools. If you need help finding them, <a href=\\\"https://webmasters.stackexchange.com/questions/8525/how-do-i-open-the-javascript-console-in-different-browsers\\\">see here</a>. We'll explain how it works in a bit but for now just know that anything you put between the parenthesises gets logged out to your JavaScript console.</p>\\n<p>Let's get this little snippet working in our browser. Make a new folder (I'll just a put it on my desktop) and add an index.html file with the following in it:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-htm\\\"><code class=\\\"language-htm\\\">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;\\n&lt;html lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;\\n&lt;head&gt;\\n  &lt;title&gt;JavaScript Experiments&lt;/title&gt;\\n&lt;/head&gt;\\n&lt;body&gt;\\n  &lt;h1&gt;JavaScript Experiments!&lt;/h1&gt;\\n  &lt;script src=&quot;./experiments.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\\n&lt;/body&gt;\\n&lt;/html&gt;</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>That <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">script</code> tag is going to let us load JavaScript code into out HTML page. So make another file in the same folder called <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">experiments.js</code> (it really can be called anything as long as the script tag matches it.) Then in the that JS file put our code from above:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-javascript\\\"><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\"><span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">const</span> monthlyRent <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">=</span> <span class=\\\"token number\\\">500</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n\\n<span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">const</span> yearlyRent <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">=</span> monthlyRent <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">*</span> <span class=\\\"token number\\\">12</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\nconsole<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span><span class=\\\"token function\\\">log</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span>yearlyRent<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span></code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>Now, if you open your <strong>HTML</strong> file, not the JS file, in your browser and open your console, you should see the number <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">6000</code> being printed.

You just wrote your first code!</p>\\n<h2 id=\\\"numbers-strings-and-booleans\\\"><a href=\\\"#numbers-strings-and-booleans\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a>Numbers, Strings, and Booleans</h2>\\n<p>So far we've just dealt with numbers. Let's go further and start working with words and characters. In programming, we refer to these things are strings, as in a string of one-letter characters. An example of this would be</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-javascript\\\"><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\"><span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">const</span> myName <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">=</span> <span class=\\\"token string\\\">\\\"Brian Holt\\\"</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\nconsole<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span><span class=\\\"token function\\\">log</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span>myName<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span></code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>You can see I use the \\\" (double quote) to enclose everything I want to be in the string. In JavaScript you can also use ' (single quote) and ` (back tick) as well to demarcate strings.</p>\\n<p>Strings, as you may imagine, are everywhere in programming. We're constantly keeping track of names, addresses, names of products, cities, etc. and thus constantly need strings.</p>\\n<p>Let's go further. Strings let you connect them together through string concatenation. If I want to be able to greet someone based on their name, I might have something like this:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-javascript\\\"><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\"><span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">const</span> firstName <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">=</span> <span class=\\\"token string\\\">\\\"Brian\\\"</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n<span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">const</span> lastName <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">=</span> <span class=\\\"token string\\\">\\\"Holt\\\"</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n\\n<span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">const</span> sentence <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">=</span> <span class=\\\"token string\\\">\\\"Hello \\\"</span> <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">+</span> firstName <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">+</span> <span class=\\\"token string\\\">\\\" \\\"</span> <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">+</span> lastName <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">+</span> <span class=\\\"token string\\\">\\\"! How are you!?\\\"</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n<span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">const</span> sentenceWithTemplate <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">=</span> <span class=\\\"token template-string\\\"><span class=\\\"token string\\\">`Hello </span><span class=\\\"token interpolation\\\"><span class=\\\"token interpolation-punctuation punctuation\\\">${</span>firstName<span class=\\\"token interpolation-punctuation punctuation\\\">}</span></span><span class=\\\"token string\\\"> </span><span class=\\\"token interpolation\\\"><span class=\\\"token interpolation-punctuation punctuation\\\">${</span>lastName<span class=\\\"token interpolation-punctuation punctuation\\\">}</span></span><span class=\\\"token string\\\">! How are you!?`</span></span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n\\nconsole<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span><span class=\\\"token function\\\">log</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span>sentence<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\nconsole<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span><span class=\\\"token function\\\">log</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span>sentenceWithTemplate<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span></code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>The first way is the old way. We can use the <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">+</code> to tell JavaScript to connect two strings. Notice how we have insert the space between <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">firstName</code> and <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">lastName</code>. The computer only does exactly what you tell it to do. If you don't insert that space, it doesn't get put there.</p>\\n<p>The second line is the new way of doing this. JavaScript got a large update in 2015 and it made things a lot easier. Now you can use the back tick (notice the first uses a double quote, you must use back ticks to do template strings) to do template strings. If you do that, anything inside of <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">${yourVariableHere}</code> gets output in the string. Cool, right?</p>\\n<h3 id=\\\"booleans\\\"><a href=\\\"#booleans\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a>Booleans</h3>\\n<p>Sometimes you just need a simple true or false.

In this case, we are asking, is two plus two still equal to four. If this is true (I hope so) then again the first block will be run. If not, the second will be.</p>\\n<p>Let's talk about <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">===</code> for a second. If you use just one <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">=</code> in JavaScript, it means <strong>is assigned to</strong>. So when we have <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">const isBrianCool = true;</code> you can verbalize that as \\\"The variable isBrianCool is assigned to true\\\". Thus we can't use that inside of the if statement because that's not we mean. We're trying to ask a question, not assign something. We're trying to ask \\\"is two plus two equal to four.\\\" Enter the triple equals. Triple equals is the same as asking \\\"is this equal to that.\\\" We use the triple equals instead of the double equals because double equals does a lot of funny business that usually we don't want it to do. It does what's called coercion and we'll talk about that below. But in an example <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">2 == &quot;2&quot;</code> but it does not <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">2 === &quot;2&quot;</code>. String 2 is double equal to number 2 but string 2 is not triple equal to number 2.</p>\\n<p>There's also <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">!==</code>.

I wish there was a better way. Before we explore that, let's chat about this example a tad more.</p>\\n<p>We used <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">let</code> instead of <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">const</code>. Things that are <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">const</code> cannot be reassigned later. In general I find this be of minor help but others do not so I leave you to make your own judgement call. In general one should try to follow the \\\"principle of least power.\\\" You should always choose the least powerful \\\"thing\\\" to accomplish whatever you're trying to do. Things with less power tend to be simpler and simple things are less prone to having or causing bugs. We instead use <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">let</code> here because you can see on the subsequent lines we do reassign <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">friendsAtYourParty</code> to be a different number. If you used <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">const</code> your code would crash because <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">const</code> won't let you do that. Thus here we use <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">let</code>. There's another one called <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">var</code> that is the old way of doing JavaScript. There are differences but I don't see a reason to use <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">var</code> at all anymore. It behaves more similar to <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">let</code>.</p>\\n<p>Okay, so, we want to do this better, let's explore a few ways to do that using loops.</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-javascript\\\"><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\"><span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">let</span> friendsAtYourParty <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">=</span> <span class=\\\"token number\\\">0</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n<span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">while</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span>friendsAtYourParty <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">&lt;</span> <span class=\\\"token number\\\">10</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span>\\n  friendsAtYourParty <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">=</span> friendsAtYourParty <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">+</span> <span class=\\\"token number\\\">1</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span>\\nconsole<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span><span class=\\\"token function\\\">log</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span>friendsAtYourParty<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span></code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>This is a while loop. The first part works similar to an <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">if</code> statement: as long as what's inside that statement is <strong>true</strong> it will continue running and re-running the body (what's between the <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">{ }</code>) until that statement is false. Once that statement is false, it'll break the loop and continue on. This case, we add 1 to <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">friendsAtYourParty</code> until it's 10, and then the next loop, when it's 10, it'll stop because 10 is not less than 10.</p>\\n<p>Also, let's just show you a few shortcuts for adding one to a thing</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-javascript\\\"><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\"><span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">let</span> friendsAtYourParty <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">=</span> <span class=\\\"token number\\\">0</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\nfriendsAtYourParty <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">=</span> friendsAtYourParty <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">+</span> <span class=\\\"token number\\\">1</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\nfriendsAtYourParty <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">+=</span> <span class=\\\"token number\\\">1</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\nfriendsAtYourParty<span class=\\\"token operator\\\">++</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n<span class=\\\"token operator\\\">++</span>friendsAtYourParty<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\nconsole<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span><span class=\\\"token function\\\">log</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span>friendsAtYourParty<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span></code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>Those four lines are equivalent. They all do the exact same thing: they add one to the existing total. The second one, the plus-equals line, you can put any number there and it'll add that amount to total, so <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">friendsAtYourParty += 15;</code> would add 15 to the total. It also works with <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">-=</code> (subtraction,) as well as <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">*=</code> (multiplication,) <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">/=</code> (division,) and <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">**=</code> (exponent.) Two last two lines (<code class=\\\"language-text\\\">++</code> before or after) just signify add one. They more-or-less mean the same thing (there's a subtle different of <em>when</em> it adds one that should never matter to you) but suffice to say everyone in the JavaScript community <em>always</em> does the <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">++</code> after; I've never seen anyone do it before in JavaScript.</p>\\n<p>Okay, so now let's see a second kind of loop to achieve the same effect as above.</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-javascript\\\"><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\"><span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">let</span> friendsAtYourParty <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">=</span> <span class=\\\"token number\\\">0</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n<span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">for</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">let</span> i <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">=</span> <span class=\\\"token number\\\">0</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span> i <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">&lt;=</span> <span class=\\\"token number\\\">10</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span> i<span class=\\\"token operator\\\">++</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span>\\n  friendsAtYourParty<span class=\\\"token operator\\\">++</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span>\\nconsole<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span><span class=\\\"token function\\\">log</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span>friendsAtYourParty<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span></code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>This is a for loop which is likely the most common kind of loop. Inside the parens are three statements and you need all of them. The <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">let i = 0;</code> is you defining your control variable that will control the loop. For some reason people always use <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">i</code>, not sure why. It's just that way. It really could be anything. The second statement <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">i &lt;= 10</code> is just like the while loop, is that's the statement that is as soon as it's false it breaks the loop. The last statement, <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">i++</code> is that happens at the end of every loop. In our case, we increment the control variable <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">i</code> so that it creeps closer to the end of the loop each time.</p>\\n<p>An important note: in coding, we start counting from 0. In English, we count <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">1, 2, 3, 4, 5, etc.</code> but in coding we count <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">0, 1, 2, 3, 4, etc.</code>. So the fifth element of a string is index 4 (where index is how we'd refer to where that item is in the string). Index 0 is the first element. It's weird but you get used to it and it makes a lot of things easier.</p>\\n<p>Sometimes, if you mess up what's inside the control condition for the loop, you'll get a runaway loop that'll never complete. This is called an <strong>infinite loop</strong> and it'll lock up and crash your code. Something like this:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-js\\\"><code class=\\\"language-js\\\"><span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">let</span> friendsAtYourParty <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">=</span> <span class=\\\"token number\\\">1</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n<span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">while</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span>friendsAtYourParty <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">></span> <span class=\\\"token number\\\">0</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span>\\n  friendsAtYourParty <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">=</span> friendsAtYourParty <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">+</span> <span class=\\\"token number\\\">1</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span>\\nconsole<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span><span class=\\\"token function\\\">log</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span>friendsAtYourParty<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span></code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>Since you're adding one to <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">friendsAtYourParty</code> each time, and the loop will continue each time until it's less than zero, that condition will never happen. Thus it'll continue going until it crashes your code. Be careful of these. Nasty bugs.</p>\\n<h2 id=\\\"exercise\\\"><a href=\\\"#exercise\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a>Exercise</h2>\\n<p>You can use your console in your browser to see the output.

I'd try to build it first on your own but then take a look at how I'm doing it.</li>\\n<li>How I solved it is not the \\\"correct\\\" answer.

I'll gloss over <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">style</code> because I don't want you to use it but I want you know it's there.</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-htm\\\"><code class=\\\"language-htm\\\">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;\\n&lt;html lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;\\n&lt;head&gt;\\n  &lt;title&gt;My amazing HTML Document&lt;/title&gt;\\n  &lt;style&gt;\\n    .my-brand {\\n      color: red;\\n    }\\n  &lt;/style&gt;\\n&lt;/head&gt;\\n&lt;body&gt;\\n  &lt;h1 class=&quot;my-brand&quot;&gt;Check this out&lt;/h1&gt;\\n  &lt;!-- Your amazing HTML here --&gt;\\n&lt;/body&gt;\\n&lt;/html&gt;</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>See the <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">style</code> tag in the head? This allows you to write CSS directly in an HTML document. Anything inside in the <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">style</code> tag will be read as CSS and applied to the whole document. This can be useful to rapidly test something out but in reality you'll should really never need to use <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">style</code> tags.</p>\\n<p>Rather, what we want is to have an HTML document and a separate CSS document that is loaded by the HTML document. This is useful because we get to keep all the <strong>content</strong> (HTML) and the <strong>styling</strong> (CSS) separate. This is called separation of concerns and it's useful in many ways with programming. The idea is that is that you each file to focus on doing one thing and doing it well. Where possible, it's best to separate things so you have many small files instead of a few big ones. Here, we want to separate our CSS and our HTML into different pages.</p>\\n<p>What that looks like:</p>\\n<p>Our index.html file:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-htm\\\"><code class=\\\"language-htm\\\">&lt;html lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;\\n&lt;head&gt;\\n  &lt;title&gt;My amazing HTML Document&lt;/title&gt;\\n  &lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; href=&quot;./style.css&quot; /&gt;\\n&lt;/head&gt;\\n&lt;body&gt;\\n  &lt;h1 class=&quot;my-brand&quot;&gt;Check this out&lt;/h1&gt;\\n  &lt;!-- Your amazing HTML here --&gt;\\n&lt;/body&gt;\\n&lt;/html&gt;</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>Our style.css file (located in the same folder as the index.html file)</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-css\\\"><code class=\\\"language-css\\\"><span class=\\\"token selector\\\">.my-brand</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token property\\\">color</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">:</span> red<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span></code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>The key here is the <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">&lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; href=&quot;./style.css&quot; /&gt;</code>. Let's break it down. A link tag is nearly always found in the <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">head</code> and links another file to that HTML document. Nearly always (99.9%) of the time it's to a <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">stylesheet</code>, hence the <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot;</code>. The <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">href</code> is where that other file is located. It refers to the file name. In this case, we have a file called <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">style.css</code> and it is located in the same folder as the <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">index.html</code> file, which is what the <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">./</code> part of the <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">./style.css</code> means. You could also write it as <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">&quot;style.css&quot;</code> if it's in the same directory, it also means it's located in the same folder, but I wanted you to see the <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">./</code> because you'll see it everywhere. We'll cover how it works later when we start working more with the terminal.</p>\\n<h2 id=\\\"when-to-actually-use-the-cascade\\\"><a href=\\\"#when-to-actually-use-the-cascade\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a>When to Actually Use the Cascade</h2>\\n<p>Before I told you to use the cascade as little as possible, but I did want to share with you when it can be useful to use.

buttons are relatively similar and differ only in colors but the spacing and text styling are all the same. It'd be nice if we could write the common styles in one rule and then overrule just the colors. We can, using the cascade!</p>\\n<p>Since those classes come lower on the page, they \\\"win\\\" on the properties that they conflict with, and thus we only overwrite the things we want. Why is this better? Imagine later you want to change the text to be smaller and the border to be thinner. Now instead of having to change for each button, you change it once in their common class, <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">.ex-btn</code> and that affects all of them! This principle is generally called <strong>DRY</strong> which stands for \\\"don't repeat yourself\\\", meaning if you can one place for common code or rules, it's better to do that than have it in 50 different places. While having three copies of the same rules doesn't seem like a big deal, many websites will have 10+ sorts of buttons and it quickly becomes impossible to manage.</p>\\n<h2 id=\\\"devtools\\\"><a href=\\\"#devtools\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a>DevTools</h2>\\n<p>Your browser has fantastic dev tools built into it.

In fact, CSS has a lot of hidden defaults, just like by-default all text's color is black. With <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">display</code>, it varies by what type of tag we're talking about. <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">div</code>s are <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">display: block;</code> by default while <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">span</code>s are <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">display: inline;</code> and this makes sense given their functions. However, being that we have access to CSS, we can manipulate a <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">span</code> to act like a <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">div</code> and vice-versa (though usually you'd just use the appropriate tag.) We'll list out a few of the options here of what <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">display</code> can be.</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><code class=\\\"language-text\\\">inline</code> – Like it sounds, it makes whatever the <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">tag</code> is behave like text. If you I want to style some text inline, this is how to do. The key here is the browser will determine all the height, width, padding, margins, etc. for you and <strong>will not let you change it</strong>. This is a common pitfall for those learning. If you have something and you're trying to set the width or height and it's not respecting it, it's probably the wrong <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">display</code> type.</li>\\n<li><code class=\\\"language-text\\\">block</code> – <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">div</code>s and <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">p</code>s by default are <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">display: block;</code>. This give you control over the height, width, padding, margins, etc. of something. By default, something that is <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">block</code> takes the whole line to itself.</li>\\n<li><code class=\\\"language-text\\\">inline-block</code> – A hybrid of the previous two. This will make browser try to place the tag inline, but will still allow you to control the height, width, padding, and margins. Like this box: <div class=\\\"long-inline-box\\\"></div> This wouldn't be possible with either of the previous.</li>\\n<li><code class=\\\"language-text\\\">flex</code> and <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">inline-flex</code> – Similar to <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">block</code> in that it affects the tags around it like <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">block</code> does, however it gains some new super power on how its interior tags are layed out. There's a section below where we'll talk about <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">flex</code>.</li>\\n<li><code class=\\\"language-text\\\">grid</code> and <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">inline-grid</code> – More advance display mode that allow you more power to layout tags <em>inside</em> of them. CSS-Tricks and Frontend Masters both have useful tutorials on these and they are definitely worth your time.</li>\\n<li><code class=\\\"language-text\\\">table</code> – Make something act like a <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">table</code>. In general, use the <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">&lt;table&gt;&lt;/table&gt;</code> tag instead of using CSS to make things act like <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">table</code>s.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h3 id=\\\"height-width-padding-border-and-margin\\\"><a href=\\\"#height-width-padding-border-and-margin\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a>Height, Width, Padding, Border, and Margin</h3>\\n<p>Again, these properties cannot be manipulated if something is <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">display: inline</code>. Be careful of that.</p>\\n<p>Something is a <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">block</code> or <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">block</code>-like has several measurements that add up to its whole.</p>\\n<div class=\\\"margin-container\\\">\\n  <div class=\\\"box-model\\\"><span class=\\\"interior-span\\\">Interior Content</span></div>\\n</div>\\n<p>I'm using several elements here to concretely demonstrate how the box model works, but assume it was all one <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">div</code> tag. The css would look like:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-css\\\"><code class=\\\"language-css\\\"><span class=\\\"token selector\\\">.example</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token property\\\">border</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">:</span> 3px solid red<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token property\\\">padding</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">:</span> 5px<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token property\\\">margin</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">:</span> 25px<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token property\\\">background-color</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">:</span> white<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span></code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>The <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">background-color</code> of the parent of the container is <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">blue</code>. The <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">2px dashed green</code> border is added by me to show padding. So let's pick this apart, starting from the outside and working in.</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><code class=\\\"language-text\\\">margin</code> – This is the space <strong>outside</strong> of the element between it and other elements. It is outside of the border. If you give something a <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">background-color</code>, it will not color in the margin space. This is used to space elements out from other elements.</li>\\n<li><code class=\\\"language-text\\\">border</code> – Next is the border. If your element has a border, it comes next (not everything has or needs a border.)</li>\\n<li><code class=\\\"language-text\\\">padding</code> – Inside the border is the <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">padding</code>. This is the spacing <strong>inside</strong> the element. If you give something a <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">background-color</code>, you will color the padding space. In our diagram above, you can see the space between the red, solid border and the green, dashed border. This is the padding of the element.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>Right now, the above element doesn't have a set <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">height</code> or <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">width</code>, which means it will take its height from what ever inside of it and it will try to take <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">100%</code> of the width it can. We can modify both of these. However, if I say <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">width: 200px</code>, <em>what</em> is <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">200px</code> wide? Unfortunately, the answer is it depends. It depends on what the value of the <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">box-sizing</code> property. By default, it does things the old way of writing code which if I say <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">width: 200px</code> I am <em>not including</em> the <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">border</code> or the <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">padding</code>. This is annoying because if I'm trying to fit things together well, it's much easier to include <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">border</code> and <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">padding</code>. Remember how I told you to never use the wild card selector before? This is the one exception where I permiss you to:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-css\\\"><code class=\\\"language-css\\\"><span class=\\\"token selector\\\">*</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token property\\\">box-sizing</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">:</span> border-box<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span></code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>This will make everything use the <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">border-box</code> sizing instead of the default one (which is called <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">content-box</code> but you'll never have to know that.) This is the first thing I put in every project I start. You'll need it once in one file. This will make everything by-default be <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">border-box</code> and thus be easier to work with. This used to be controversial to use but <a href=\\\"https://www.paulirish.com/2012/box-sizing-border-box-ftw/\\\">here is Paul Irish (really smart guy who works on Google Chrome)</a> saying it's okay.</p>\\n<h2 id=\\\"laying-out-tags\\\"><a href=\\\"#laying-out-tags\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a>Laying Out Tags</h2>\\n<p>There are a few ways to accomplish layouts.

The idea behind float is you'll an element to push itself as far left or right as possible, and once it's out of space, go to the next line. I'll put an example on the line below.

However, once you wrap <strong>both</strong> boxes 2 and 3, you'll see that box 3 won't go all the way up next to 1; it stays at the same vertical position as 2. Since box 2 is higher in the HTML, box 3 cannot go higher on the page due to the way that CSS works. This is just one limitation of floats. They have peculiar behavior that's tough to understand. Let's move on and talk about flex which makes it much easier to handle.</p>\\n<h3 id=\\\"flex\\\"><a href=\\\"#flex\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a>Flex</h3>\\n<p><code class=\\\"language-text\\\">display: flex;</code> is a display mode for CSS. It's to note that when you stick <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">display: float</code>, it allows you to to change the layout <strong>inside</strong> the tag. It allows you to change the layout of its children. Externally, it acts just like <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">block</code>. Likewise there is a <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">inline-flex</code> which acts just like <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">display: inline-block</code> externally.</p>\\n<p>Flex allows for a lot of interesting patterns but we're going to scratch the surface today. Take <a href=\\\"https://frontendmasters.com/courses/css-grids-flexbox/\\\">Jen Kramer's course</a> or read the <a href=\\\"https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/\\\">CSS Tricks article</a> to learn more. We're going to explore same case today. Flex lets you tell CSS how to lay out the items inside a tag. We can tell the them to be left aligned, bottom aligned, center aligned, whatever you want. You can even throw them into columns. I think this is best taught by example so let's just throw a bunch on the page. All of them will have the following CSS:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-html\\\"><code class=\\\"language-html\\\"><span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">&lt;</span>style</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">></span></span><span class=\\\"token style language-css\\\">\\n  <span class=\\\"token selector\\\">.flex-container</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span>\\n    <span class=\\\"token property\\\">display</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">:</span> flex<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n    <span class=\\\"token property\\\">width</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">:</span> 100%<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n    <span class=\\\"token property\\\">border</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">:</span> 1px solid black<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span>\\n</span><span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">&lt;/</span>style</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">></span></span>\\n<span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">&lt;</span>div</span> <span class=\\\"token attr-name\\\">class</span><span class=\\\"token attr-value\\\"><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">=</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">\\\"</span>flex-container<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">\\\"</span></span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">></span></span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">&lt;</span>div</span> <span class=\\\"token attr-name\\\">class</span><span class=\\\"token attr-value\\\"><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">=</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">\\\"</span>box-1<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">\\\"</span></span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">></span></span>1<span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">&lt;/</span>div</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">></span></span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">&lt;</span>div</span> <span class=\\\"token attr-name\\\">class</span><span class=\\\"token attr-value\\\"><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">=</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">\\\"</span>box-2<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">\\\"</span></span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">></span></span>2<span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">&lt;/</span>div</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">></span></span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">&lt;</span>div</span> <span class=\\\"token attr-name\\\">class</span><span class=\\\"token attr-value\\\"><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">=</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">\\\"</span>box-3<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">\\\"</span></span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">></span></span>3<span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">&lt;/</span>div</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">></span></span>\\n<span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">&lt;/</span>div</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">></span></span></code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>And we'll just be changing three properties: <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">flex-direction</code>, <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">justify-content</code>, and <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">align-items</code>.

We showed you how to make a CSS rule so that you can make every <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">p</code> on the page have green text instead of black which is amazing. However, as you start building bigger websites, you begin to have more complicated needs: you may need <em>this</em> <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">p</code> to have green text and that <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">p</code> to have <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">red</code> text. We haven't shown you yet how to make two of the same tag be styled different. Let's start showing you how to do this so you can achieve things like this:</p>\\n<p class=\\\"red-text\\\">This is a red p.</p>\\n<p class=\\\"green-text\\\">This is a green p.</p>\\n<p>So how do we achieve this black magic? Do you remember <a href=\\\"http://localhost:8000/html-next-steps#classes\\\">the section on classes</a> in the HTML portion? We're going to use that now. Classes allow us to style the same <strong>tags</strong> (e.g. <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">p</code>, <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">div</code>, <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">span</code>, etc.) differently because we can select the class instead of the tag. This is where having useful class names helps. So now, if we have an <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">h1</code> that's the title of a blog post and an <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">h1</code> that's the branding logo at the top, we can do this:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-htm\\\"><code class=\\\"language-htm\\\">&lt;h1 class=&quot;branding&quot;&gt;My Super Cool Brand&lt;/h1&gt;\\n&lt;!-- other htmls … these don&#39;t have to be sibiling tags --&gt;\\n&lt;h1 class=&quot;blog-post-title&quot;&gt;My Cool Blog Post&lt;/h1&gt;</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>We can CSS to address these two differently. Like so:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-html\\\"><code class=\\\"language-html\\\"><span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">&lt;</span>style</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">></span></span><span class=\\\"token style language-css\\\">\\n  <span class=\\\"token selector\\\">.branding</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span>\\n    <span class=\\\"token property\\\">color</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">:</span> red<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span>\\n\\n  <span class=\\\"token selector\\\">.blog-post-title</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span>\\n    <span class=\\\"token property\\\">color</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">:</span> limegreen<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span>\\n</span><span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">&lt;/</span>style</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">></span></span>\\n<span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">&lt;</span>h1</span> <span class=\\\"token attr-name\\\">class</span><span class=\\\"token attr-value\\\"><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">=</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">\\\"</span>branding<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">\\\"</span></span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">></span></span>My Super Cool Brand<span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">&lt;/</span>h1</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">></span></span>\\n<span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">&lt;</span>h1</span> <span class=\\\"token attr-name\\\">class</span><span class=\\\"token attr-value\\\"><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">=</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">\\\"</span>blog-post-title<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">\\\"</span></span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">></span></span>My Cool Blog Post<span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">&lt;/</span>h1</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">></span></span></code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>In the CSS, notice the <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">.</code> (period) before the class name. This is how you differentiate between a tag name (like <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">h1</code>) and a class name (like \\\"branding\\\".)</p>\\n<p>So what should you use, generally speaking. Classes. Almost always classes. This is the consensus in the front end development community. Classes are the best way to style web pages. There are rare occasions that it may be useful style on tags (like if you literally want to style every <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">a</code> tag on the page) but those cases are rare. Use classes.

This is the part where CSS can become unnecessarily complicated, even if the ability to use the cascade is occasionally useful. Before we dive in, avoid using this ability of CSS where-ever possible. It'll save you hours-and-hours of debugging, I promise.</p>\\n<p>So, the cascade. What if you have two CSS classes that have conflicting properties? Which one \\\"wins\\\" and is applied? Let's see an example.</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-html\\\"><code class=\\\"language-html\\\"><span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">&lt;</span>style</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">></span></span><span class=\\\"token style language-css\\\">\\n  <span class=\\\"token selector\\\">.title</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span>\\n    <span class=\\\"token property\\\">color</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">:</span> red<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span>\\n\\n  <span class=\\\"token selector\\\">.title</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span>\\n    <span class=\\\"token property\\\">color</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">:</span> green<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span>\\n</span><span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">&lt;/</span>style</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">></span></span>\\n<span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">&lt;</span>h1</span> <span class=\\\"token attr-name\\\">class</span><span class=\\\"token attr-value\\\"><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">=</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">\\\"</span>title<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">\\\"</span></span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">></span></span>Cool Title<span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">&lt;/</span>h1</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">></span></span></code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>In this one, we have two rules with the same class (which is \\\"legal\\\" CSS.) So which one gets applied? Since they're equal, the one that comes <strong>last</strong> wins. So in this case, the <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">h1</code> would be green. So remember that rule (we'll recap at the end): when everything is equal, the <em>last one</em> gets applied. It'd work the same if we had two <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">h1</code> selectors as well.</p>\\n<p>Okay, one step more complicated:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-html\\\"><code class=\\\"language-html\\\"><span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">&lt;</span>style</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">></span></span><span class=\\\"token style language-css\\\">\\n  <span class=\\\"token selector\\\">.main-brand-2</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span>\\n    <span class=\\\"token property\\\">border</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">:</span> 1px solid black<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n    <span class=\\\"token property\\\">color</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">:</span> red<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span>\\n\\n  <span class=\\\"token selector\\\">.title-2</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span>\\n    <span class=\\\"token property\\\">color</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">:</span> green<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span>\\n</span><span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">&lt;/</span>style</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">></span></span>\\n<span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">&lt;</span>h1</span> <span class=\\\"token attr-name\\\">class</span><span class=\\\"token attr-value\\\"><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">=</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">\\\"</span>title-2 main-brand-2<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">\\\"</span></span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">></span></span>Branding here<span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">&lt;/</span>h1</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">></span></span></code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>First of all, yes, one tag can have multiple classes, and that can be useful. Okay, so what is this going to look like? In the eyes of CSS, those two selectors are equal since they both have the same <strong>specificity</strong> (key word, you'll see it used a lot when talking about CSS.) They both specific one class which makes them equal. So in this case, since <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">.title</code> comes last in the CSS, it wins. The color will be green. What about the border? Since <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">.title</code> doesn't conflict, it'll have a black border too. So keep in mind that each of these \\\"conflicts\\\" is resolved on a property-by-property basis. So the end result in an <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">h1</code> that has a black border and green font.</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-html\\\"><code class=\\\"language-html\\\"><span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">&lt;</span>style</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">></span></span><span class=\\\"token style language-css\\\">\\n  <span class=\\\"token selector\\\">.main-brand-3.title-3</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span>\\n    <span class=\\\"token property\\\">color</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">:</span> red<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span>\\n\\n  <span class=\\\"token selector\\\">.title-3</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span>\\n    <span class=\\\"token property\\\">color</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">:</span> green<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span>\\n</span><span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">&lt;/</span>style</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">></span></span>\\n<span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">&lt;</span>h1</span> <span class=\\\"token attr-name\\\">class</span><span class=\\\"token attr-value\\\"><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">=</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">\\\"</span>title-3 main-brand-3<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">\\\"</span></span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">></span></span>Branding here<span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">&lt;/</span>h1</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">></span></span></code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>This how you add two classes to one selector. Notice there's no space between the two class names (that means something else.) The selector <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">.main-brand.title</code> will only match a tag that has <strong>both</strong> classes. If has only one of the two, it will not match. As you may imagine, since it has two classes, it's more specific, and therefore it wins.</p>\\n<p>Okay, next steps here:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-html\\\"><code class=\\\"language-html\\\"><span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">&lt;</span>style</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">></span></span><span class=\\\"token style language-css\\\">\\n  <span class=\\\"token selector\\\">.title-4</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span>\\n    <span class=\\\"token property\\\">color</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">:</span> orange<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span>\\n\\n  <span class=\\\"token selector\\\">h1</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span>\\n    <span class=\\\"token property\\\">color</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">:</span> green<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span>\\n</span><span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">&lt;/</span>style</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">></span></span>\\n<span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">&lt;</span>h1</span> <span class=\\\"token attr-name\\\">class</span><span class=\\\"token attr-value\\\"><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">=</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">\\\"</span>title-4<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">\\\"</span></span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">></span></span>Another h1<span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">&lt;/</span>h1</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">></span></span></code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>This one is less obvious. Now we have to understand specificity even more. <strong>A class is considered more specific than a tag</strong>. So a class selector \\\"overpowers\\\" a tag selector. It's more specific. Therefore, even though the <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">h1</code> selector comes last, the <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">.title</code> wins because it's more specific. This is why it's useful to do <em>everything</em> using classes; you don't need to worry about these specificity wars if everything is equal and try to have it some you don't have conflicting rules (which is not always possible.)</p>\\n<p>A useful but imperfect way to think about this is to think of specificity like a number. The class is like the tens digit, and the tag is like the ones digit. So something with one class selector would have a number <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">10</code> specificity and something with one tag selector would a specificty of <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">1</code>. The bigger number wins. This is imperfect because one class selector is still bigger than 10 tag selectors, but it's a useful mental device to quickly evaluate mentally which tag is more specific.</p>\\n<p>Last one and we'll move on:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-html\\\"><code class=\\\"language-html\\\"><span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">&lt;</span>style</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">></span></span><span class=\\\"token style language-css\\\">\\n  <span class=\\\"token selector\\\">h1.main-brand-5</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span>\\n    <span class=\\\"token property\\\">color</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">:</span> red<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span>\\n\\n  <span class=\\\"token selector\\\">.main-brand-5.title-5</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span>\\n    <span class=\\\"token property\\\">color</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">:</span> orange<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span>\\n\\n  <span class=\\\"token selector\\\">.main-brand-5</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span>\\n    <span class=\\\"token property\\\">color</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">:</span> green<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span>\\n</span><span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">&lt;/</span>style</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">></span></span>\\n<span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">&lt;</span>h1</span> <span class=\\\"token attr-name\\\">class</span><span class=\\\"token attr-value\\\"><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">=</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">\\\"</span>title-5 main-brand-5<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">\\\"</span></span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">></span></span>Another Example<span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">&lt;/</span>h1</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">></span></span></code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>The first selector, <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">h1.main-brand</code> is how you select both a tag and a class at the same time. As you may imagine, this is more specific than the third selector, <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">.main-brand</code>. If you remember our shortcut trick, the first selector would be 11, the second would be 20, and the last would be 1, making the second selector the most specific, and indeed it is. The first selector isn't a good idea to do; using a tag and a class is usually a bad idea and means you're likely doing something weird in your code. I'm just showing you because it does happen in a lot in exisitng code.</p>\\n<h2 id=\\\"ids-and-important\\\"><a href=\\\"#ids-and-important\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a>IDs and !important</h2>\\n<p>The next two I'm going to show you should nearly never use.

We're going to start reasoning about how to put together these things, how to create our blueprints, our plans. CSS is really powerful and can accomplish a wide variety of things: colors, sizes, order, positioning, hiding, showing, animation, etc. We'll scratch the surface here but know you can do a lot with just CSS. It's a deep subject and a powerful tool.</p>\\n<p>Like HTML, CSS is not a programming language. It's a list of rules that you give the browser. You'll provide rules to the browser like \\\"all <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">h1</code>s will be colored red.\\\" We'll explore why this is different than JavaScript later, but know that's the gist.</p>\\n<h2 id=\\\"style\\\"><a href=\\\"#style\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a>Style</h2>\\n<p>We'll first explore the most apparent way to use CSS: to effect visual changes on your HTML. Imagine an <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">h1</code> like this:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-htm\\\"><code class=\\\"language-htm\\\">&lt;h1&gt;This is an h1.&lt;/h1&gt;</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>So far so good. What if we wanted to instead make the h1 be red instead? Like this</p>\\n<h1 class=\\\"step-one\\\">This is an h1.</h1>\\n<p>We're going to write a CSS rule that makes the the case. That would look like:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-css\\\"><code class=\\\"language-css\\\"><span class=\\\"token selector\\\">h1</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token property\\\">color</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">:</span> red<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span></code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>That's it! There's your first CSS. Let's dissect each piece of this rule:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><code class=\\\"language-text\\\">h1</code> — This is what we'd call the <strong>selector</strong>. Anything that matches this selector is going to have everything inside the <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">{ }</code>. These selectors can be a wide variety of things but for now we're just selecting <em>every</em> <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">h1</code> on the page. That's important to keep in mind too: it'll apply the changes to everything that matches that selector.</li>\\n<li><code class=\\\"language-text\\\">color:</code> – This is called the <strong>property</strong>. There are about <a href=\\\"https://meiert.com/en/indices/css-properties/\\\">~350 properties</a> that you can use but to be honest you'll never use all of them. Maybe fifty to hundred are used frequently and the rest are a long tail that are rarely used. The <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">color</code> property affects the color of the font (as well as some other things but for now just assume it means font color.)</li>\\n<li><code class=\\\"language-text\\\">red</code> – This is the <strong>value</strong>. This identifying what the value of the property is going to be. In this case, we're telling the color to be red. There are variety of ways to define color in CSS. This called using \\\"named color\\\", of which there are about <a href=\\\"https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/named-colors-and-hex-equivalents/\\\">150 different colors</a> that CSS understands. CSS also understands hex values like <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">#ff0000</code>, rgb values like <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">rgb(255, 0, 0)</code>, and hsl values like <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">hsl(0, 100%, 50%)</code>. All those values I gave in the previous sentence are the same color as <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">red</code>. You don't actually need to understand how these values work to understand web programming or CSS and I would assert most web developers don't. If you need to understand, here's a great article on it from <a href=\\\"https://css-tricks.com/nerds-guide-color-web/\\\">CSS Tricks</a>.</li>\\n<li><code class=\\\"language-text\\\">;</code> – Every property-value pair will end in a semicolon. Think of it like a period/full-stop to end of a sentence. This is how the computer knows you're done with that property and moving on.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>So let's go a step further. Let's make our h1 even more different! Let's make it limegreen, bigger, not bold (<code class=\\\"language-text\\\">h1</code>s are by-default bold), underlined, uppercased, and have pink border!</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-css\\\"><code class=\\\"language-css\\\"><span class=\\\"token selector\\\">h1</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token property\\\">color</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">:</span> limegreen<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token property\\\">font-size</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">:</span> 60px<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token property\\\">font-weight</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">:</span> normal<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token property\\\">text-decoration</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">:</span> underline<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token property\\\">text-transform</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">:</span> uppercase<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token property\\\">border</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">:</span> 3px solid pink<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span></code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<h1 class=\\\"step-two\\\">This is an h1</h1>\\n<p>Notice the HTML we're using for this is still: <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">&lt;h1&gt;This is an h1&lt;/h1&gt;</code>. Nothing has changed there! This is all just using a CSS rule the affect how it looks. Pretty cool, right? Also notice that one selector can have multiple properties and that one property can have multiple values! Let's dissect that.</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><code class=\\\"language-text\\\">color: limegreen;</code> – We used this before, but now we're using the color <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">limegreen</code>!</li>\\n<li><code class=\\\"language-text\\\">font-size: 60px;</code> – <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">font-size</code> is how we make text bigger or smaller. Since we wanted to make it bigger, we made it 60 pixels tall which is quite large. The <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">px</code> represent the unit of measurement here. Just it's different say something is five feet long, five inches long, or five meters long, so too is it different to say something is <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">60px</code> or <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">60em</code>. CSS has a bunch of different measurements, but <em>most</em> things are measured in <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">px</code>, <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">em</code>, or <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">rem</code>. <a href=\\\"https://css-tricks.com/the-lengths-of-css/\\\">See this CSS Tricks article</a> if you want see more about the various measurements of CSS.</li>\\n<li><code class=\\\"language-text\\\">font-weight: normal;</code> – Like I stated previously, <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">h1</code>s are bold by default. This is how you tell the browser to keep the text's weight to normal. There are more things you <em>can</em> do here, but typically you're only telling it be bold or normal.</li>\\n<li><code class=\\\"language-text\\\">text-decoration: underline;</code> – This is how you tell it underline the text. Mostly text-decoration is used for that but you'll can also see <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">line-through</code> for strikethrough or <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">overline</code> for … overlining purposes? Yeah, I'm not sure. But you can do it!</li>\\n<li><code class=\\\"language-text\\\">text-transform: uppercase;</code> – This can be a bit confusing because we're not changing the text inside the HTML tag but we're making everything upprecase. This is what <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">text-transform</code> can do for you. It will also do <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">lowercase</code> or <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">capitalize</code> (the latter being capitalize the first letter of each word.) Be careful with this since if your website supports other languages, changing the cases of letters will modify the meaning.</li>\\n<li><code class=\\\"language-text\\\">border: 3px solid pink;</code> – This is how you make borders around items. First, notice the border goes all the way to the edge of the page. That's because <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">h1</code>s take the whole line even though they don't necessarily have text to fill that. We'll address this later when we talk about the block model but it's good to know that now. So notice we have three values there for the one property: <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">3px</code>, <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">solid</code>, and <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">pink</code>. These are all separate and could be put in any order (ie you could say <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">border: solid pink 3px;</code> and it's the same.) The <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">3px</code> represents the thickness of the border, the <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">solid</code> represents that it's a solid line (it could be <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">dotted</code>, <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">dashed</code>, <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">double</code>, or a few others) and <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">pink</code> represents the color of the border. This actually an example of a combined CSS property, a shortcut. You could separate this out as <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">border-style: solid;</code>, <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">border-color: pink;</code>, and <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">border-width: 3px;</code>. You'll see a lot of these in CSS.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h2 id=\\\"parents-and-children\\\"><a href=\\\"#parents-and-children\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a>Parents and Children</h2>\\n<p>You'll notice that if I have HTML like this:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-htm\\\"><code class=\\\"language-htm\\\">&lt;div&gt;\\n  &lt;h1&gt;An h1&lt;/h1&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>And I have CSS that looks like this:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-css\\\"><code class=\\\"language-css\\\"><span class=\\\"token selector\\\">div</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token property\\\">color</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">:</span> blue<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span></code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>The <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">h1</code> will be colored blue.

It was invented in 1993! While I'm sure the originators and the early adopters of HTML did their best to make they could, there's no way they could have anticipated that we'd still be using it 25 years and they needs we'd have. As such, HTML has had to evolve in many unexpected ways and part of that is removing bad parts and mistakes that used to HTML as we go along. When they remove bad stuff and add good stuff, they make a new version of HTML. The way we tell the browser that's reading the HTML what version of HTML we're using is this first tag. This particular one is for HTML5, the latest (as of writing) revision of HTML. HTML doesn't get revised very often so this will be the header you'll use for a long time to come.</p>\\n<h4 id=\\\"html-langenhtml\\\"><a href=\\\"#html-langenhtml\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a><code class=\\\"language-text\\\">&lt;html lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</code></h4>\\n<p>Everything (besides the doctype) goes into your <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">html</code> tag.

There are several types of <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">input</code>s that we discussed in the previous section: text, color, checkboxes, radio buttons, etc. How can the browser tell which is meant to be what? HTML attributes! Attributes are additional pieces of information that you can attach to HTML tags.

Instead, you'd make a rule that says \\\"walls marked <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">south-facing-wall</code> are south facing.\\\" This is what classes allow you to do: they allow you to mark your HTML so you can write rules and code to govern them later.

If I wrote a rule targeting <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">h1</code>s, I'd get all the <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">post-title</code>s <strong>and</strong> the <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">header-title</code> as well.

Whereas you'll be using classes everywhere and frequently, you should be using IDs very sparingly. As you see in our above <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">blog-posts</code> HTML, we can <em>re-use</em> classes like <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">post</code> and <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">post-title</code>. This is <strong>extremely</strong> important. As a coder, you want a piece of code and use it a lot. As coders, we want to write as little code as possible (which we'll explore why later, for now trust me.) For now, be satisfied that I get to write a little bit of code that governs <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">post</code> and have it affect every <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">post</code> on the page.</p>\\n<p>Let's contrast that with IDs. When you designate something with an ID, you're affirming that <strong>this is the only one of those on your website</strong>. Not even just that page, but your whole website. <em>Sometimes</em> that is useful; just not very often. Some other coders and tutorials will tell you to <em>never</em> use IDs; I think that's misguided. IDs are a sledgehammer. Most problems don't require a sledgehammer. However sometimes you have problems that need a sledgehammer and then you're really grateful that you have one.</p>\\n<p>Let's see what an ID would look like:</p>\\n<div

has an <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">id</code> attribute in addition to its class. Notice I gave it a name <em>very</em> specific to that post; I can probably guarantee that the only house metaphor post on my website so that name works. Later we'll go more in depth on this, but you don't want to use CSS to tag IDs. You probably don't need to use JavaScript to target it; classes normally suffice.</p>\\n<p>So why do we have them? Well, they're really old and have been around forever so that's the mean reason. Another reason that <em>is</em> very useful about IDs is that I now can make a link that takes you directly to that ID in the page. Try clicking this <a href=\\\"#the-h1-part-way-down-the-page\\\">link</a> (it won't leave this page.)</p>\\n<h3 id=\\\"the-h1-part-way-down-the-page\\\">The link should bring you here.</h3>\\n<p>This is done using just an ID. The code for that link is: <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">&lt;a href=&quot;#the-h1-part-way-down-the-page&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;</code>. That <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">#</code> means go to that ID on the page.</p>\\n<h2 id=\\\"naming-and-tags-to-use\\\"><a href=\\\"#naming-and-tags-to-use\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a>Naming and Tags to Use</h2>\\n<p>You generally want to give things useful names. There's a saying in computer science that there are two hard things in computer science: cache invalidation, naming things, and off-by-one errors. (Cache invalidation is another topic for another day.) So if you struggle to come up with names for things like classes and IDs, you're not alone. As a programmer you get to name <em>a lot</em> of things.</p>\\n<p>Generally, with classes, you want to name things <em>semantically</em>. This is a fancy word (often used when talking about HTML) that you want use tags and name things as close to what thing <em>is</em> and <strong>not</strong> <em>what it looks like</em>.</p>\\n<p>Example, imagine this is a blog post on my website.</p>\\n<style>\\n  .post-title {\\n    color: red;\\n    font-size: 20px;\\n  }\\n  .post-title.green {\\n    color: limegreen;\\n  }\\n  .post-text {\\n    font-size: 14px;\\n  }\\n  .post {\\n    border: 3px solid #ccc;\\n    border-radius: 5px;\\n    max-width: 400px;\\n    padding: 10px;\\n  }\\n</style>\\n<article class=\\\"post\\\">\\n  <h1 class=\\\"post-title\\\">MY COOL BLOG POST TITLE</h1>\\n  <p class=\\\"post-text\\\">Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Sint exercitationem dignissimos veritatis, odit accusamus reiciendis dolorum ab harum dolorem ad et ducimus amet ut eos, itaque nostrum cumque magni soluta.</p>\\n</article>\\n<p>For the blog post title, what should I call the class? What tag should I use? I really can use any tag and it'll mechanically work. Using CSS, you can make pretty much any tag look and act like any other. So if it doesn't matter mechanically, why should it matter to me? The same reasons we layed out earlier:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>It makes the site accessible to everyone if you choose good tags. It's your resposibility to make sure the web remains accessible to everyone, including but not limited to: people with limited sight, limited motion of hands, arms or other limbs, limited hearing, and other permanent or temporary disabilities.</li>\\n<li>It'll make it easier for you to come back later and maintain your code or for someone else to understand what you did. Code is communication between you and future readers.</li>\\n<li>It makes it easier for Google, Bing, DuckDuckGo, etc. to crawl your website which means your site will rank higher.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>Given that, it means we need to choose a tag that means that's a title. In this case, we can use an <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">h1</code> because that is the main header of that subsection. For the name of the class (note screen readers and other accessibility tools <em>do not</em> read your class names or IDs; choosing good names here purely affects you and others working on this code.)</p>\\n<p>Okay, cool, so let's give that <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">h1</code> a good class name. How about <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">red-title</code>? It's a title and it's red; fits, right? While that may seem appropriate and fitting now, what if you need to change your blog's styling the following week and now that blog post looks like this:</p>\\n<article class=\\\"post\\\">\\n  <h1 class=\\\"post-title green\\\">MY COOL BLOG POST TITLE</h1>\\n  <p class=\\\"post-text\\\">Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Sint exercitationem dignissimos veritatis, odit accusamus reiciendis dolorum ab harum dolorem ad et ducimus amet ut eos, itaque nostrum cumque magni soluta.</p>\\n</article>\\n<p>If your title is still called <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">red-title</code>, you have a bit of a problem! Now your class name is not only not descriptive of what the item is, it's actually wrong which will make it way more confusing to you and other laters. Now, you may say that you can just change the class name when you go to update but believe me that's not a good option either. If you've used that class 1,000 times throughout your website (not that farfetched) you'd have to update 1,000 different things. No, it's better if we give it a good name the first time, descriptive of not <em>what it looks like</em> but descriptive of <em>what role it serves.</em> In this case, we could call it something like <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">blog-post-title</code> or <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">post-head</code> or something of that nature. That class then always be desciptive of what the thing <em>is</em> and not <em>what it looks like</em>.</p>\",\"frontmatter\":{\"path\":\"/html-next-steps\",\"title\":\"HTML Next Steps\",\"order\":4}},\"allMarkdownRemark\":{\"edges\":[{\"node\":{\"frontmatter\":{\"order\":0,\"path\":\"/intro\",\"title\":\"Introduction to the Course\"}}},{\"node\":{\"frontmatter\":{\"order\":1,\"path\":\"/overview\",\"title\":\"Overview of What You'll Be Learning In This Course\"}}},{\"node\":{\"frontmatter\":{\"order\":2,\"path\":\"/tools\",\"title\":\"Tools\"}}},{\"node\":{\"frontmatter\":{\"order\":3,\"path\":\"/basic-html\",\"title\":\"Basic HTML\"}}},{\"node\":{\"frontmatter\":{\"order\":4,\"path\":\"/html-next-steps\",\"title\":\"HTML Next Steps\"}}},{\"node\":{\"frontmatter\":{\"order\":5,\"path\":\"/meta-html\",\"title\":\"Meta HTML\"}}},{\"node\":{\"frontmatter\":{\"order\":6,\"path\":\"/basic-css\",\"title\":\"Basic CSS\"}}},{\"node\":{\"frontmatter\":{\"order\":7,\"path\":\"/selectors\",\"title\":\"CSS Selectors and the Cascade\"}}},{\"node\":{\"frontmatter\":{\"order\":8,\"path\":\"/layout-css\",\"title\":\"Layout CSS\"}}},{\"node\":{\"frontmatter\":{\"order\":9,\"path\":\"/css-patterns\",\"title\":\"Effective Patterns for Writing CSS\"}}},{\"node\":{\"frontmatter\":{\"order\":10,\"path\":\"/project-html-css\",\"title\":\"Project: HTML & CSS\"}}},{\"node\":{\"frontmatter\":{\"order\":11,\"path\":\"/programming-fundamentals\",\"title\":\"Programming Fundamentals\"}}},{\"node\":{\"frontmatter\":{\"order\":12,\"path\":\"/functions-and-scope\",\"title\":\"Functions and Scope\"}}},{\"node\":{\"frontmatter\":{\"order\":13,\"path\":\"/objects-and-arrays\",\"title\":\"Objects and Arrays\"}}},{\"node\":{\"frontmatter\":{\"order\":14,\"path\":\"/dom\",\"title\":\"The DOM\"}}},{\"node\":{\"frontmatter\":{\"order\":15,\"path\":\"/js-project\",\"title\":\"JavaScript, HTML, and CSS Project\"}}},{\"node\":{\"frontmatter\":{\"order\":16,\"path\":\"/ajax\",\"title\":\"AJAX\"}}},{\"node\":{\"frontmatter\":{\"order\":17,\"path\":\"/libraries\",\"title\":\"Integrating with Other People's Libraries\"}}},{\"node\":{\"frontmatter\":{\"order\":18,\"path\":\"/git-and-bash\",\"title\":\"Git and Bash\"}}},{\"node\":{\"frontmatter\":{\"order\":19,\"path\":\"/node\",\"title\":\"Node.js\"}}},{\"node\":{\"frontmatter\":{\"order\":20,\"path\":\"/deploying\",\"title\":\"Deploying Your App\"}}},{\"node\":{\"frontmatter\":{\"order\":21,\"path\":\"/final-thoughts\",\"title\":\"Final Thoughts\"}}}]}},\"pathContext\":{}}\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./.cache/json/html-next-steps.json\n// module id = 477\n// module chunks = 0","module.exports = {\"data\":{\"markdownRemark\":{\"html\":\"<p>We're going to start building our very first website.

A tag is a building block. It describes what's inside it. Every tag has an opening and a closing tag (some tags open and close at the same point.) I think the easiest way to learn it is just to show a bunch of examples.</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-html\\\"><code class=\\\"language-html\\\"><span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">&lt;</span>h1</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">></span></span>This is the title to my document<span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">&lt;/</span>h1</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">></span></span></code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>You can see the <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">&lt;h1&gt;</code> and the <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">&lt;/h1&gt;</code> surrounding the the text \\\"This is the the title to my document\\\". This is how HTML operates. You can have opening tag which has information or more tags inside of it. In this case we have an <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">h1</code> tag which is a heading tag: it's used for the biggest title on the page, typically a title. If you rendered that using the browser, it's look like:</p>\\n<h1>This is the title to my document</h1>\\n<p>It's bigger and bolder because that's what browsers do with h1s, it makes them look important on the page. However it does more than that too. Browsers aren't the only thing reading websites. Blind and people who can't see well will use screen readers to read web pages out loud to them; it uses things like headers to understand what information is important to read to the users. It's also how Google and Bing will understand the important details of your website. In other words, it's important which type of tag you use. More than just the visual aesthetic is using those tags.</p>\\n<p>A tag, whether it's opening or closing, are surrounded by angle brackets, <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">&lt;</code> and <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">&gt;</code>. Closing tags always have a slash, <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">/</code>, after the opening angle bracket, so it looks like <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">&lt;/h1&gt;</code>. There are things called \\\"self-closing tags\\\" or \\\"void tags\\\" that open and close themselves. These will look like this: <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">&lt;input /&gt;</code> (I'll explain in a sec what inputs are.) That slash at the end means it is self closing. To make it more confusing, that last slash is optional, so <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">&lt;input&gt;</code> (with no closing tag ever) is valid too since input tags are always self-closing.</p>\\n<p>Tags are also opened and and closed in a specific order too. The most recently opened tag must be the next closed tag. For example, if I have an h1 instead of a div, the h1 must be closed first.</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-html\\\"><code class=\\\"language-html\\\"><span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">&lt;</span>div</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">></span></span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">&lt;</span>h1</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">></span></span>\\n    Hi\\n  <span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">&lt;/</span>h1</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">></span></span>\\n<span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">&lt;/</span>div</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">></span></span></code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>The above is correct.</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-htm\\\"><code class=\\\"language-htm\\\">&lt;div&gt;\\n  &lt;h1&gt;\\n    Hi\\n  &lt;/div&gt;\\n&lt;/h1&gt;</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>The above is incorrect.

These are the six levels of headings and subheadings you can have. You can see up top of this page we have <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">HTML</code> which is an h1 and then below that we have <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">Types of Tags</code> which is an h2. An h2 is a subheading to an h1. An h3 is a subheading to a h2. Some schools of thought say each page should only have one h1. I'm of the opinion that just use these as it feels appropriate to. Like formatting a Microsoft Word document, there's no \\\"correct\\\" way to do it, just different ways that make more or less sense. Example <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">&lt;h1&gt;Document Title&lt;/h1&gt;</code>.</li>\\n<li><code class=\\\"language-text\\\">p</code> – Paragraph. You'll put a paragraph of text together inside of a <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">p</code> tag. Only text goes in <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">p</code> tags. Each one of these paragraphs is a <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">p</code> tag. Example: <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">&lt;p&gt;A paragraph of text&lt;/p&gt;</code>.</li>\\n<li><code class=\\\"language-text\\\">a</code> – Anchor. An <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">a</code> tag is a link to somewhere else. <a href=\\\"#\\\">This is a link that goes nowhere</a>. Every <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">a</code> tag needs a destination of where the link should take you. We'll talk about that in the <strong>Attributes</strong> section. Example: <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.frontendmasters.com&gt;Frontend Masters&lt;/a&gt;</code>.</li>\\n<li><code class=\\\"language-text\\\">div</code> – Short for division. A div is sort of like a cardboard box. It's not really anything by itself; it's more defined by what's in it. It's a generic container tag for grouping together other things. You'll use a lot of divs. Very useful with CSS. In general, you want to group together \\\"like\\\" things into a containing tag (like a div) to keep them together. If you have a website with a list of blog posts that each have paragraphs, titles, images, etc. you'll group each post together in a div or other container-type tag typically.</li>\\n<li><code class=\\\"language-text\\\">span</code> – A container for small pieces of text. If a div is like a cardboard box, a span is like a Ziploc bag. It doesn't change the styling of anything by itself but it allows you use CSS and JavaScript later to make that text different in some way. Example: <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">&lt;p&gt;Here is some text. &lt;span&gt;This text is in a span&lt;/span&gt; but it doesn&#39;t look any different.&lt;/p&gt;</code></li>\\n<li><code class=\\\"language-text\\\">ol</code>, <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">ul</code>, and <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">li</code> – Both <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">ol</code> and <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">ul</code> represent lists. In fact, this list of various tags is a <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">ul</code>! A <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">ul</code> is an unordered list: it's a list of things that could be shuffled and still mean the same thing. If I asked you to list all the teams in a sports league, or all the characters on a TV show, those could be presented in any order. An <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">ol</code> is an organized list: what comes first matters. If I ask you to list out the ten most populous cities in the world, there is an order to that and changing the order makes the list incorrect. In either list, each item in the list is an <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">li</code>. Example: <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bob&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Eve&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Alice&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</code></li>\\n<li><code class=\\\"language-text\\\">button</code> – A … button. A button can be used by JavaScript to respond to a user clicking it, or it can be used by a form to signal a user has completed it filling it and it should submit the data. Think of it like a doorbell to your house: you can put the doorbell button there but it's not going to do much unless you connect it to the buzzer. Example: <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">&lt;button&gt;Click me!!&lt;/button&gt;</code></li>\\n<li><code class=\\\"language-text\\\">img</code> – An image. You use this to load images onto the page. This can be confusing because you can use CSS to bring in images too. The key difference is that when the image is apart of the content, like a diagram that shows data you're talking about or a picture that shows something from the article, it should be an <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">img</code> tag. If it's a nice background image or something that's for decoration of your website, use CSS. An <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">img</code> tag needs a <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">src</code> to say where the image is coming from and <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">alt</code> to say what is in the image for screen readers so that the image will still be useful to blind people, people who are hard of seeing, and Google and Bing search engines. <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">img</code> are always self-closing tags. Example: <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.placepuppy.net/100/100&quot; alt=&quot;an adorable puppy&quot; /&gt;</code></li>\\n<li><code class=\\\"language-text\\\">input</code> – Browser inputs. Sometimes you need to gather input from the user. Luckily for us, the browser is already really good at doing that. It gives us several types of inputs that you can use. One of the most common ones is the text input, seen here: <input value=\\\"you can type in me\\\" />. You can also have these <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">input</code> tags do numbers, dates, colors, checkboxes, radio buttons, and others. We'll explore them more later when we talk about forms. Inputs are always self-closing tags. Example: <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">&lt;input /&gt;</code>.</li>\\n<li><code class=\\\"language-text\\\">textarea</code> – Similar to an input but for a lot more text. You'd type long-form responses in here that could linebreaks in it (a linebreak happens when you hit \\\"return\\\" or \\\"enter\\\" on your keyboard.) Despite never having anything inside of a <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">textarea</code>, it is not a self-closing tag. HTML is a really old language and so we have to live with some old quirks. Example: <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">&lt;textarea&gt;&lt;/textarea&gt;</code></li>\\n<li><code class=\\\"language-text\\\">select</code> and <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">option</code> — Sometimes you want to limit a user to a certain group of options to select from. What country you're from, what month you were born in, etc. A <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">select</code> is a user-interactive input that a user can select an option from a dropdown menu. An <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">option</code> is one of the available options. Each <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">option</code> needs a value that will be sent back to the server if the user select that <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">option</code>. What's inside of the option is what shown to the user. Example: <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">&lt;select&gt;&lt;option value=&quot;seattle&quot;&gt;Seattle&lt;/option&gt;&lt;option value=&quot;portland&quot;&gt;Portland&lt;/option&gt;&lt;option value=&quot;san-francisco&quot;&gt;San Francisco&lt;/option&gt;&lt;/select&gt;</code></li>\\n<li><code class=\\\"language-text\\\">form</code> – A group of html tags related to gathering data from a user. This will be some combination of <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">input</code>, <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">textarea</code>, and <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">select</code> tags. You can then use this <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">form</code> element to send that data to your server. A <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">form</code> tag itself doesn't show anything; it's a just a container for the other tags. We'll use them more later. For now, just know they exist. Example: <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">&lt;form&gt;&lt;input /&gt;&lt;textarea&gt;&lt;/textarea&gt;&lt;/form&gt;</code></li>\\n<li><code class=\\\"language-text\\\">table</code>, <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">tr</code>, and <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">td</code> – Like making a table in Word or Excel. If you have a table of data, this is the best way to display it. Just for your context, we used to do terrible, awful things with <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">table</code>s to make websites, way back when. Because of that, some tutorial will tell you never ever use <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">table</code>s. That's not good either because when you have tabular data (something you would put into Excel) then <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">table</code>s are very useful. The <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">table</code> is the container for the whole table, <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">tr</code> represents a row, and <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">td</code> represents one cell in the table. Example: <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;(0,0)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;(1,0)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;(0,1)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;(1,1)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;</code></li>\\n<li>There are many, many, many more tags. This is just a highlight of some of the more useful, common ones.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h2 id=\\\"comments\\\"><a href=\\\"#comments\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a>Comments</h2>\\n<p>We, as coders, forget what things do. We write things that are really complicated or we know will be difficult to figure out later. Something to keep in mind is that you are mostly writing code for yourself to read later, not for the computer. The hardest part of writing code is having to maintain it later, not writing it the first time. Writing code the first time is the easier part. Going back and trying to remember what the hell you were thinking is the hard part.</p>\\n<p>This is where comments can be useful. You can leave little notes in your code that the computer won't read, it'll just ignore them. In HTML, the way you write a comment is <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">&lt;!-- your comments go here --&gt;</code>. Leave whatever notes you need in between the <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">&lt;!--</code> and the <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">--&gt;</code> so that later you can come back to your code and remember what you were doing. Be careful of going overboard because comments like <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">&lt;h1&gt;Title of the Article&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;!-- the title --&gt;</code> aren't useful because it's pretty obvious that's the title. It's best to have code that describes itself and don't need comments; however when that falls apart comments can help.</p>\\n<h2 id=\\\"playground\\\"><a href=\\\"#playground\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a>Playground</h2>\\n<p>I've embedded a little widget here for you to play with the HTML elements we've talked about. This is through a website called <a href=\\\"\\\">CodePen</a>. I use this site all the time and we'll use it a lot throughout this entire workshop for quick little demos and lessons. Instead of having to set up all your tools and such, this will give you quick access to run these demos online.</p>\\n<p>On the left, you'll see the HTML that you can edit. On the right you'll see what that HTML looks like as if it was being run on a website. You can edit the left pane and on the right pane you'll instantly see it being displayed. Take some time to toy around with it and see what happens when you edit it and rearrange things. Learning comes easily during play. We'll get to making our own websites from scratch but this is a good place to start with and not get burdened down with some of the details.</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre

While I'm not a Windows or Linux dev (or least haven't been for a long time) I'll try to make sure we get you in with some good tools. What's important here is that you find what works for you. Every developer has very strong opinions about their tools and will tell you that is some reason you <em>have</em> to use their tool. Don't listen to them. Find what works for you. If you find yourself fighting your tools more than they're helping you, consider trying something else. Keep an open mind. What's shiny or popular is not necessarily going to work for you. Take time to invest in making your tools work the best for you.

You may not be yet aware but your browser has a myriad of developer tools built into it that help you understand your code, helps you find bugs, and helps you experiment directly on your running website. All of the modern browsers are great and you can use any one of them to develop sites with. I recommend you pick one and really get to know its developers tools.</p>\\n<h3 id=\\\"my-recommendation-firefox\\\"><a href=\\\"#my-recommendation-firefox\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a>My Recommendation: Firefox</h3>\\n<p><a href=\\\"https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/\\\">Download Firefox</a></p>\\n<p>I've been a big Mozilla fan for a long time and Firefox just keeps getting better. The developer tools are amazing and the team behind them are amazing too. All of my workshop will be done using Firefox.</p>\\n<p>That being said, Edge, Safari, or <a href=\\\"https://www.google.com/chrome/\\\">Chrome</a> are all very, very good browsers with great dev tools too. If you feel comfortable with one of these already, stick with it.

There are so many strongly-held opinions that it's hard to tell which one is going to work for you. There are many flavors and it all depends on what you want out of your editor: do you want it to hold your hand as much as possible? Do you want it to get out of the way? I'm going to give you several choices but let's start with what I've been using for a few years now.</p>\\n<h3 id=\\\"my-recommedation-visual-studio-code\\\"><a href=\\\"#my-recommedation-visual-studio-code\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a>My Recommedation: Visual Studio Code</h3>\\n<p><a href=\\\"https://aka.ms/visual-studio-code\\\">Download Visual Studio Code</a></p>\\n<p>Perhaps unsurprisingly I'm choosing the editor that Microsoft created. However I've been using VSCode (which is how I'll refer to Visual Studio Code from now on) since I was working at Netflix. It's a fantastic editor that has a lot of convenient features and helpers. To me it's the right balance of minimalism and helpers. It works in particular really well with front end development as well, and since the editor itself is JavaScript-based, if you ever feel like adding a new feature or plugin to it, you'll already know the correct language to do so. It's free, open-source, and works well on Mac, Linux, and Windows. And perhaps one of the best features of VSCode is it has a <a href=\\\"https://aka.ms/vscode-marketplace\\\">huge amount of available plug ins</a></p>\\n<p>If you're not feeling VSCode, two other editors that are similar in their offering are <a href=\\\"https://www.sublimetext.com/\\\">Sublime Text 3</a> and <a href=\\\"https://atom.io\\\">Atom</a>. Both are great. I used Sublime for a decade and I still like it. Both are free to download. Sublime has an unlimited trial that asks you to pay $80 when you can.</p>\\n<p>If you want a more complete offering, you may investigate using an integrated development environment (commonly called an IDE.) The reigning, best IDE for front end development is <a href=\\\"https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/\\\">WebStorm</a>. WebStorm is a very powerful IDE that has a lot of features and tools built into it. It aims to be more than just an editor; it aims to be the entire development suite. Great tool.</p>\\n<p>Lastly, I'm going to simply state there are two more tools you could use: <a href=\\\"https://www.vim.org/\\\">vim</a> and <a href=\\\"https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/\\\">emacs</a>. These are tool that you use in the command line / terminal and use <em>just</em> the keyboard, no mouse. These tools have a very difficult learning curve but once you're productive in them they allow you to go very fast. My advice for you is: don't, especially right now as you're learning to code. If you want to revisit it later then you could do that. But just know that it is indeed quite difficult.</p>\\n<h2 id=\\\"the-terminal\\\"><a href=\\\"#the-terminal\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a>The Terminal</h2>\\n<p>You're going to learn to use a terminal during this workshop. It's less scary than it seems, I promise! There are two things to worry about when talking about the terminal, and I'll try to help you tell the difference between the two: the <strong>shell</strong> and the <strong>terminal emulator</strong>. The terminal emulator is the actual window in your operating system; it itself doesn't execute or understand your commands you're sending to it. The shell is the code running inside of the terminal emulator. This shell can be swapped out to whatever shell you want to run. Unlike the things I recommended above, these various terminal emulators and shells vary a lot more by operating system.</p>\\n<p>If this is confusing to you, it's okay. It's a minor detail that you can come back to later.</p>\\n<p>For the terminal emulator, it doesn't matter a whole lot which one you use. I personally use <a href=\\\"https://www.iterm2.com/\\\">iTerm2</a> but you can just as easily use the default Mac Terminal.app or <a href=\\\"https://hyper.is/\\\">Hyper</a> for Mac. For Windows, I'm told the aforementioned Hyper also works well as well as <a href=\\\"http://cmder.net/\\\">cmder</a>. If you're on Linux, I'd say just use whatever the OS's default emulator is. You can use any one of these and this workshop will function entirely the same.</p>\\n<p>For the shell, we are going to use <a href=\\\"https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/\\\">bash</a>. You don't need to install it unless you're using Windows (<a href=\\\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10\\\">then use these steps to enable it</a>). It's 99% already there on your computer unless you're using some obscure flavor of Linux. Whenever you open your Mac terminal, it'll be running bash by default unless you've changed it.</p>\\n<p>There are other options. The reason we use bash is because it is <em>so prevalent</em>. Bash is everywhere. Everything you Google will have the answers written in bash. My favorite shell is actually <a href=\\\"https://fishshell.com/\\\">fish</a> but it's not very popular. Another shell people swear by is <a href=\\\"http://www.zsh.org/\\\">zsh</a>. These are all very cool but I recommend looking at these later.</p>\\n<h2 id=\\\"trusted-resources\\\"><a href=\\\"#trusted-resources\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a>Trusted Resources</h2>\\n<p>Something really important is that you choose to learn from good sources. Just like it's important to get your news from quality sources, it's important to get your technical information from sound sources. Here are some of my personal favorites:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>For anything to do with HTML, CSS, or JavaScript, Mozilla's <a href=\\\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/\\\">MDN</a> is my go-to. I literally have it open all the time.</li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://css-tricks.com/\\\">CSS Tricks</a> has fashioned itself into a premier development website. It has great content not just for CSS but for HTML and JavaScript too. If I want a tutorial, I'll head there. If I want more technical how-to info, I head to MDN.</li>\\n<li>For video content, you really can't beat the rest of the content on <a href=\\\"https://frontendmasters.com/\\\">Frontend Masters</a>. I love it.</li>\\n<li>If I'm working with a library or a framework, it's a good idea to head directly to their GitHub (we'll talk about GitHub later) page or their official documentation. It's best to head straigh to the source.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>Frontend Masters also puts out a really awesome book every year called the <a href=\\\"https://frontendmasters.com/books/front-end-handbook/2018/\\\">Frontend Handbook</a>.

For now we're calling them languages. The three languages you are going to learn are HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. We will also be using some other tools like the command line and git but we'll get there too.</p>\\n<h2 id=\\\"the-house\\\"><a href=\\\"#the-house\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a>The House</h2>\\n<p>Why do you need three languages? Let's make the imperfect metaphor of building a house. To build a house you need tools (like your text editor, your browser, your command line.) After you have tools, you need all the building material: the 2x4s, the shingles, the dry wall, the windows: all the things you need to put together to make a house. This is the HTML, or hypertext markup langauge. However this house thus far isn't going to be very pretty to look and not very functional. It's not going to have any color or any sort of elaborate structures. It's going to be bland, inert, and boring. Likewise, you can a website that's <em>just</em> HTML but it's going to be a black-and-white text document with no style or interactivity.</p>\\n<p>In order to arrange, style, and generally make this house more useful, you're going to have some blueprints. In an overly-reductive way, you could think of the blueprints as being a set of rules: this 2x4 goes here, that shingling goes on the roof, this particular wall be blue, and this window goes here. You define a bunch of rules that dictates that if some item matches this condition, then some rule is applied to it. If it is a 9x15 wall, it goes on the south side of the house. This is the CSS of your house, or the cascading style sheets. CSS is a series of rules that define that if you are an HTML thing that matches this condition, then apply some style to it. If you are the first paragraph in an article, your font size is 25px and your font color is blue.</p>\\n<p>Okay, so now we have a well arranged and nice looking house. Now, being the modern age and me wanting all the gadgets, I want to install a whole slew of smart home devices. I want it so when I pull in the driveway with my smart-enabled car that the garage door opens, the lights turn on, the thermostat turns on the heat, the TV is set to continue my favorite TV show, and the smart cooker begins cooking dinner. I am adding behavior to my house; I am adding a layer of programming on top of what exists. This is like frontend, or client-side, JavaScript. It's adding a layer of behavior on top of your website. Do you want to pop up a message if a user clicks a button? Do you want to refresh the stock-ticker on the page so it's accurate? Do you want to change the picture that's showing on your page every few seconds? These are things you'd typically do with JavaScript. And like all the smart home devices, having JavaScript on your page isn't always necessary. These website, for example, wouldn't need any JavaScript whatsoever because it's just showing information and not really interactive (links are an HTML thing, you don't need JavaScript for them.) It does have JavaScript because it makes it easier for me but it'd be easy to do with zero JavaScript.</p>\\n<p>Now, if I want to order delivery to my house, I have to call someone else. Someone not at my house. I'd use my smart assistant and ask them to call a pizza place and ask them to deliver pizza to my house. The pizza place in this example would be like a backend server. One pizza place can serve many houses, and it probably only does a few things (like make pizza, salad, drinks, etc.) and deliver that to all sorts of clients. The clients in this case could be different peoples' computers, phones, smart assitants, smart watches, smart ovens, who knows!? So one server can service many clients. In this case we're just worried about people's browsers (like Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari, etc.) on their computers and phones. While the frontend code (the smart house stuff) is <em>always</em> in JavaScript, the backend code can be in any number of languages: Python, Ruby, JavaScript, Java, Go, C#, etc. Today we will only be using JavaScript on both the frontend and the backend so you don't have to learn two languages, but just know you <em>could</em> use a different language on the backend.</p>\\n<p>To recap:</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>The HTML is the structure. It's going to contain all the text, the various images tied to the text, and it will generally group things together. Just like the drywall in your house, HTML doesn't do anything other than exist. It relies on other things to do things for it and to it.</li>\\n<li>The CSS is the blueprint. It's all the rules of what goes where, what color it is, what size it is, what font it is, what the decorative background images are, Like HTML, CSS doesn't <em>do</em> anything, it's just a set of rules that describe what things go where and how they look.</li>\\n<li>The frontend / client JavaScript is the smart home. It's all the cool pre-programmed stuff you can tell your house to do. JavaScript is what can change the HTML and CSS to react to various stimuli.</li>\\n<li>The backend code (we'll still use JavaScript) is the pizza place. It's a place where we can request things from and it will send back what we ask for. Or we can send things to it, like when you upload a new photo to your social media account. One server serves many clients, just like one pizza place serves many homes.</li>\\n</ol>\\n<h2 id=\\\"a-note-about-this-courses-website\\\"><a href=\\\"#a-note-about-this-courses-website\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a>A Note About This Course's Website</h2>\\n<p>In this course you'll see two different types of code samples. This is specific to this website and not to the web at large. The first is when it has a light yellow background and only has one section, like this:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-htm\\\"><code class=\\\"language-htm\\\">&lt;h1&gt;This is a code example. It&#39;s not editable&lt;/h1&gt;</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>Then there are code samples like this that have white backgrounds and are in two pieces. These are editable and you can see the results instantly! Check it out:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-html\\\"><code class=\\\"language-html\\\"><span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token tag\\\"><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">&lt;</span>h1</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">></span></span>This is a code example.

If you see one that is editable, please play with it. You'll learn a lot by experimentation.</p>\",\"frontmatter\":{\"path\":\"/overview\",\"title\":\"Overview of What You'll Be Learning In This Course\",\"order\":1}},\"allMarkdownRemark\":{\"edges\":[{\"node\":{\"frontmatter\":{\"order\":0,\"path\":\"/intro\",\"title\":\"Introduction to the Course\"}}},{\"node\":{\"frontmatter\":{\"order\":1,\"path\":\"/overview\",\"title\":\"Overview of What You'll Be Learning In This Course\"}}},{\"node\":{\"frontmatter\":{\"order\":2,\"path\":\"/tools\",\"title\":\"Tools\"}}},{\"node\":{\"frontmatter\":{\"order\":3,\"path\":\"/basic-html\",\"title\":\"Basic HTML\"}}},{\"node\":{\"frontmatter\":{\"order\":4,\"path\":\"/html-next-steps\",\"title\":\"HTML Next Steps\"}}},{\"node\":{\"frontmatter\":{\"order\":5,\"path\":\"/meta-html\",\"title\":\"Meta HTML\"}}},{\"node\":{\"frontmatter\":{\"order\":6,\"path\":\"/basic-css\",\"title\":\"Basic CSS\"}}},{\"node\":{\"frontmatter\":{\"order\":7,\"path\":\"/selectors\",\"title\":\"CSS Selectors and the Cascade\"}}},{\"node\":{\"frontmatter\":{\"order\":8,\"path\":\"/layout-css\",\"title\":\"Layout CSS\"}}},{\"node\":{\"frontmatter\":{\"order\":9,\"path\":\"/css-patterns\",\"title\":\"Effective Patterns for Writing CSS\"}}},{\"node\":{\"frontmatter\":{\"order\":10,\"path\":\"/project-html-css\",\"title\":\"Project: HTML & CSS\"}}},{\"node\":{\"frontmatter\":{\"order\":11,\"path\":\"/programming-fundamentals\",\"title\":\"Programming Fundamentals\"}}},{\"node\":{\"frontmatter\":{\"order\":12,\"path\":\"/functions-and-scope\",\"title\":\"Functions and Scope\"}}},{\"node\":{\"frontmatter\":{\"order\":13,\"path\":\"/objects-and-arrays\",\"title\":\"Objects and Arrays\"}}},{\"node\":{\"frontmatter\":{\"order\":14,\"path\":\"/dom\",\"title\":\"The DOM\"}}},{\"node\":{\"frontmatter\":{\"order\":15,\"path\":\"/js-project\",\"title\":\"JavaScript, HTML, and CSS Project\"}}},{\"node\":{\"frontmatter\":{\"order\":16,\"path\":\"/ajax\",\"title\":\"AJAX\"}}},{\"node\":{\"frontmatter\":{\"order\":17,\"path\":\"/libraries\",\"title\":\"Integrating with Other People's Libraries\"}}},{\"node\":{\"frontmatter\":{\"order\":18,\"path\":\"/git-and-bash\",\"title\":\"Git and Bash\"}}},{\"node\":{\"frontmatter\":{\"order\":19,\"path\":\"/node\",\"title\":\"Node.js\"}}},{\"node\":{\"frontmatter\":{\"order\":20,\"path\":\"/deploying\",\"title\":\"Deploying Your App\"}}},{\"node\":{\"frontmatter\":{\"order\":21,\"path\":\"/final-thoughts\",\"title\":\"Final Thoughts\"}}}]}},\"pathContext\":{}}\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./.cache/json/overview.json\n// module id = 480\n// module chunks = 0","module.exports = {\"data\":{\"markdownRemark\":{\"html\":\"<p>Welcome to an intro to web development.

The two subjects share some overlap but also are quite different. Many artists, lawyers, historians, linguists, and others have great success learning how to code. Don't let those preconceived notions hold you back at all.</p>\\n<p>Also keep in mind that this is <em>hard</em>. Learning how to code is hard. It's similar to learning a foreign language where you have to learn a lot of small pieces of information to be able to make sense of the larger picture. It's easy to feel discouraged, especially when you feel like you <em>should</em> get something but don't. Keep your head up and keep trying. Walk away from the problem and come back later. Try explaining your problem to someone / your dog / a <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging\\\">rubber ducky</a> (seriously, it works.)</p>\\n<p>Never feel afraid to Google <em>anything</em>. Every programmer you know, from the top person in the field to the newest student is Googling things <em>constantly</em>. This isn't cheating; it's a skill. It's a requirement. There is so much information coming at you that cannot possibly remember it all. Copy and paste code. Look at StackOverflow. Ask dumb questions. You get better by repeatedly exposing yourself to information. Each time a bit more will sink in.</p>\\n<p>Don't try to understand every piece all at once. There are times where it's okay to just trust that something works and come back later to understand how. It's a tough balance because you do want to try to understand what's going on. I'll try to signal to you what's worth diving into and what's worth leaving for another day but just know you don't have to understand it all at once.</p>\\n<p>Lastly, this isn't a get-rich-quick scheme. Learning to code is hard and requires a lot of hard work. While entry-level jobs are out there and you can get them with months of work, I guarantee you you'll have to work hard for them.</p>\\n<h2 id=\\\"who-am-i\\\"><a href=\\\"#who-am-i\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a>Who Am I?</h2>\\n<p>\\n  <a\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-link\\\"\\n    href=\\\"/intro-to-web-dev-v2/static/brian-cb2dee4ec3ac88218f2a680c2885f6fc-59562.jpg\\\"\\n    style=\\\"display: block\\\"\\n    target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\n    rel=\\\"noopener\\\"\\n  >\\n  \\n  <span\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\\\"\\n    style=\\\"position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 650px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\\\"\\n  >\\n    <span\\n      class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\\\"\\n      style=\\\"padding-bottom: 100%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\\\"\\n    >\\n      <img\\n        class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-image\\\"\\n        style=\\\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\\\"\\n        alt=\\\"Brian drinking a beer\\\"\\n        title=\\\"\\\"\\n        src=\\\"/intro-to-web-dev-v2/static/brian-cb2dee4ec3ac88218f2a680c2885f6fc-b80fa.jpg\\\"\\n        srcset=\\\"/intro-to-web-dev-v2/static/brian-cb2dee4ec3ac88218f2a680c2885f6fc-cf410.jpg 163w,\\n/intro-to-web-dev-v2/static/brian-cb2dee4ec3ac88218f2a680c2885f6fc-62f2a.jpg 325w,\\n/intro-to-web-dev-v2/static/brian-cb2dee4ec3ac88218f2a680c2885f6fc-b80fa.jpg 650w,\\n/intro-to-web-dev-v2/static/brian-cb2dee4ec3ac88218f2a680c2885f6fc-08cb4.jpg 975w,\\n/intro-to-web-dev-v2/static/brian-cb2dee4ec3ac88218f2a680c2885f6fc-59562.jpg 1080w\\\"\\n        sizes=\\\"(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px\\\"\\n      />\\n    </span>\\n  </span>\\n  \\n  </a>\\n    </p>\\n<p>My name is Brian Holt.

I'd almost always rather be traveling and have been fortunate to see over thirty countries in the past five years.</p>\\n<p>Please catch up with me on social media, would love to chat:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/holtbt\\\">Twitter</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://www.instagram.com/briantholt/\\\">Instagram</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://github.com/btholt\\\">GitHub</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/btholt/\\\">LinkedIn</a></li>\\n</ul>\\n<h2 id=\\\"why-was-this-course-created\\\"><a href=\\\"#why-was-this-course-created\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a>Why was this course created?</h2>\\n<p>\\n  <a\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-link\\\"\\n    href=\\\"/intro-to-web-dev-v2/static/FrontendMastersLogo-f72cae0c73fecbb6beecea606d8fabd3-a3d33.png\\\"\\n    style=\\\"display: block\\\"\\n    target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\n    rel=\\\"noopener\\\"\\n  >\\n  \\n  <span\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\\\"\\n    style=\\\"position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 650px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\\\"\\n  >\\n    <span\\n      class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\\\"\\n      style=\\\"padding-bottom: 25.497630331753555%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABQAAAAFCAYAAABFA8wzAAAACXBIWXMAAAsSAAALEgHS3X78AAAAm0lEQVQY02NgGAhw0VCb+YCuRgQIr1RX5jihrymKV4OdnZ2cvb29LBBLODg4SAD5KkAsAuIDafGV+tpNh3U1VPfoqO8C4o6DuhqRQL4a0AI3IK17SFfD7KiepgyygSAD5IEGaAFpIyBtDKQtgBjEt203MXQAGlILxFVAQ6YAcRcQLwTiyUA8EYibD+ioNxLt5XMG2sxAF0gRoxYAu0Q0UPEUUdYAAAAASUVORK5CYII='); background-size: cover; display: block;\\\"\\n    >\\n      <img\\n        class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-image\\\"\\n        style=\\\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\\\"\\n        alt=\\\"Frontend Masters Logo\\\"\\n        title=\\\"\\\"\\n        src=\\\"/intro-to-web-dev-v2/static/FrontendMastersLogo-f72cae0c73fecbb6beecea606d8fabd3-10273.png\\\"\\n        srcset=\\\"/intro-to-web-dev-v2/static/FrontendMastersLogo-f72cae0c73fecbb6beecea606d8fabd3-9b14a.png 163w,\\n/intro-to-web-dev-v2/static/FrontendMastersLogo-f72cae0c73fecbb6beecea606d8fabd3-94962.png 325w,\\n/intro-to-web-dev-v2/static/FrontendMastersLogo-f72cae0c73fecbb6beecea606d8fabd3-10273.png 650w,\\n/intro-to-web-dev-v2/static/FrontendMastersLogo-f72cae0c73fecbb6beecea606d8fabd3-2fc6f.png 975w,\\n/intro-to-web-dev-v2/static/FrontendMastersLogo-f72cae0c73fecbb6beecea606d8fabd3-a3d33.png 1055w\\\"\\n        sizes=\\\"(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px\\\"\\n      />\\n    </span>\\n  </span>\\n  \\n  </a>\\n    </p>\\n<p>I love to teach. It's a challenging task that forces you to peel back all the knowledge you've gain so you can approach someone who lacks the same experience and terminology you have. It forces you to take amorphous concepts floating in your brain and crystalize them into solid concepts that you can describe. It forces you to acknowledge your gaps in knowledge because you'll begin to question things you know others will question. For me to ever master a concept, I have to teach it to someone else.</p>\\n<p>Unfortunately life gets in the way. These courses take dozens of hours to prepare and to get right. While I'd love to just create content all day, I have a (awesome) day job at Microsoft that demands and deserves my full attention. However I'm grateful to the team at <a href=\\\"https://frontendmasters.com/\\\">Frontend Masters</a> for giving me deadlines and incentive to create these courses and then allowing and encouraging me to open source the materials. Not everyone has the money to pay for these courses which is why these materials are and will be forever open source for you to reference and share. I think the video content is pretty good too and so I'd encourage you to take a look at that on Frontend Masters too if that's in the cards for you.</p>\",\"frontmatter\":{\"path\":\"/intro\",\"title\":\"Introduction to the
