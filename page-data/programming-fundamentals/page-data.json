Some of you are programmers from other languages who are coming here to learn front end coding. Some of you are totally new to coding and JavaScript will be your first programming language. Just like you know Spanish already, learning Italian becomes a whole lot easier since you take the same concepts and express them with minor variances. This workshop is optimizing for those totally new to coding and thus we assume no prior knowledge. If you do know another progamming language, I invite you instead to skim this section in familiarize with how JavaScript looks.

Code is for humans first and computers second. You can think of writing code as essentially writing notes on how to solve a particular problem that just happens to be in a way that computer can understand it.</p>\n<p>Wait, why? The why is because you or someone else will have to go back and re-read that code some time in the future, maybe tomorrow or maybe in ten years (I've worked on code older than 10 years old, it's not fun.) As such, it's important to write code in a such way that it's easily understandable to someone with little context. You will spend far longer maintaining this code than you will writing it the first time. Be explicit. Be deliberate. The point here is not to be clever but to be simple and to communicate clearly. Code is communication.</p>\n<p>Okay, given this, let's frame how this code works then. When you write code, the computer breaks it down into smaller pieces it can understand and then executes those one bit at a time. With JavaScript, only one thing is ever happening at a time (this is called being <em>single threaded</em> but that is not a term you need to know.) In general, this means it executes line 1, then line 2, then line 3, etc. Let's that in action:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"javascript\"><pre class=\"language-javascript\"><code class=\"language-javascript\"><span class=\"token keyword\">const</span> monthlyRent <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">500</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n\n<span class=\"token keyword\">const</span> yearlyRent <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> monthlyRent <span class=\"token operator\">*</span> <span class=\"token number\">12</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\nconsole<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">log</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>yearlyRent<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>The first thing that happens above is that we declare a variable, <code class=\"language-text\">monthlyRent</code>. The <code class=\"language-text\">const</code> keyword is how we let JavaScript know we're declaring a variable. Variable names always have to know no spaces in them, which is why we squish the words \"monthly rent\" together. In order to make this more readable, we use what's called <em>camel casing</em>, so-called because the capital letters in the middle make it look like humps on a camel. You can also use other styles of captialization, there's no rule it must be camel case in JavaScript; everyone just happens to do camel casing in JavaScript.</p>\n<p>Notice the <code class=\"language-text\">;</code> at the end of every line. This semi colon lets JavaScript know you've completed your thought. Think of this as the period/full-stop of the the programming world.</p>\n<p>Variable can be called <em>almost</em> anything. You <strong>can't</strong> use keywords. An example would be <code class=\"language-text\">const const = 15</code>. <code class=\"language-text\">const</code> is a keyword so it can't be used as a variable name. You do want to give your variables good names. Imagine we have a huge file and 200 lines below we see the variable named <code class=\"language-text\">monthlyRent</code>: we'll know instantly what this variable does and we won't have to go try to read the code to figure it out. Always, always, always use good variable names. Seriously. Put time into it. Naming things is hard and it's a big part of your job.</p>\n<p>Okay, so after line one, I have a variable named <code class=\"language-text\">monthlyRent</code> that I can use as much as I want. In this case, it represents the number of <code class=\"language-text\">500</code> but it also semantically represents monthlyRent. Imagine if I had 1000 lines between where <code class=\"language-text\">monthlyRent</code> is declared and where <code class=\"language-text\">yearlyRent</code> is calculated. I could have just put <code class=\"language-text\">500</code> directly in <code class=\"language-text\">yearlyRent</code> but I don't because I now understand how that's calculated just by reading the code. Use variables. Use them everywhere. It makes your code way easier to read. Also, later, if my monthly rent changes, I can change it one place and everywhere I reference <code class=\"language-text\">monthlyRent</code> gets updated automatically. Powerful stuff.</p>\n<p>Okay, I think calculate <code class=\"language-text\">yearlyRent</code>. I use the <code class=\"language-text\">*</code> to represent multiplication. I'm also mixing variables and numbers which is just fine. I also could have said <code class=\"language-text\">const yearlyRent = monthlyRent * monthsInAYear;</code> (assuming I put <code class=\"language-text\">const monthsInAYear = 12;</code> somewhere else) too and that would be a good idea. I would argue the two are roughly the same since it's obvious there are 12 months in a year. But you do what you think is most clear. That's your job.</p>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">console.log(yearlyRent);</code> is going to print whatever is stored in <code class=\"language-text\">yearlyRent</code> to the JavaScript console. The JavaScript Console is a part of the dev tools. If you need help finding them, <a href=\"https://webmasters.stackexchange.com/questions/8525/how-do-i-open-the-javascript-console-in-different-browsers\">see here</a>. We'll explain how it works in a bit but for now just know that anything you put between the parenthesises gets logged out to your JavaScript console.</p>\n<p>Let's get this little snippet working in our browser. Make a new folder (I'll just a put it on my desktop) and add an index.html file with the following in it:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"htm\"><pre class=\"language-htm\"><code class=\"language-htm\">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;\n&lt;html lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;\n&lt;head&gt;\n  &lt;title&gt;JavaScript Experiments&lt;/title&gt;\n&lt;/head&gt;\n&lt;body&gt;\n  &lt;h1&gt;JavaScript Experiments!&lt;/h1&gt;\n  &lt;script src=&quot;./experiments.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n&lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;</code></pre></div>\n<p>That <code class=\"language-text\">script</code> tag is going to let us load JavaScript code into out HTML page. So make another file in the same folder called <code class=\"language-text\">experiments.js</code> (it really can be called anything as long as the script tag matches it.) Then in the that JS file put our code from above:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"javascript\"><pre class=\"language-javascript\"><code class=\"language-javascript\"><span class=\"token keyword\">const</span> monthlyRent <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">500</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n\n<span class=\"token keyword\">const</span> yearlyRent <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> monthlyRent <span class=\"token operator\">*</span> <span class=\"token number\">12</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\nconsole<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">log</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>yearlyRent<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>Now, if you open your <strong>HTML</strong> file, not the JS file, in your browser and open your console, you should see the number <code class=\"language-text\">6000</code> being printed. Congrats! You just wrote your first code!</p>\n<h2 id=\"numbers-strings-and-booleans\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#numbers-strings-and-booleans\" aria-label=\"numbers strings and booleans permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Numbers, Strings, and Booleans</h2>\n<p>So far we've just dealt with numbers. Let's go further and start working with words and characters. In programming, we refer to these things are strings, as in a string of one-letter characters. An example of this would be</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"javascript\"><pre class=\"language-javascript\"><code class=\"language-javascript\"><span class=\"token keyword\">const</span> myName <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"Brian Holt\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\nconsole<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">log</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>myName<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>You can see I use the \" (double quote) to enclose everything I want to be in the string. In JavaScript you can also use ' (single quote) and ` (back tick) as well to demarcate strings.</p>\n<p>Strings, as you may imagine, are everywhere in programming. We're constantly keeping track of names, addresses, names of products, cities, etc. and thus constantly need strings.</p>\n<p>Let's go further. Strings let you connect them together through string concatenation. If I want to be able to greet someone based on their name, I might have something like this:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"javascript\"><pre class=\"language-javascript\"><code class=\"language-javascript\"><span class=\"token keyword\">const</span> firstName <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"Brian\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n<span class=\"token keyword\">const</span> lastName <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"Holt\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n\n<span class=\"token keyword\">const</span> sentence <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"Hello \"</span> <span class=\"token operator\">+</span> firstName <span class=\"token operator\">+</span> <span class=\"token string\">\" \"</span> <span class=\"token operator\">+</span> lastName <span class=\"token operator\">+</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"! How are you!?\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n<span class=\"token keyword\">const</span> sentenceWithTemplate <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token template-string\"><span class=\"token template-punctuation string\">`</span><span class=\"token string\">Hello </span><span class=\"token interpolation\"><span class=\"token interpolation-punctuation punctuation\">${</span>firstName<span class=\"token interpolation-punctuation punctuation\">}</span></span><span class=\"token string\"> </span><span class=\"token interpolation\"><span class=\"token interpolation-punctuation punctuation\">${</span>lastName<span class=\"token interpolation-punctuation punctuation\">}</span></span><span class=\"token string\">! How are you!?</span><span class=\"token template-punctuation string\">`</span></span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n\nconsole<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">log</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>sentence<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\nconsole<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">log</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>sentenceWithTemplate<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>The first way is the old way. We can use the <code class=\"language-text\">+</code> to tell JavaScript to connect two strings. Notice how we have insert the space between <code class=\"language-text\">firstName</code> and <code class=\"language-text\">lastName</code>. The computer only does exactly what you tell it to do. If you don't insert that space, it doesn't get put there.</p>\n<p>The second line is the new way of doing this. JavaScript got a large update in 2015 and it made things a lot easier. Now you can use the back tick (notice the first uses a double quote, you must use back ticks to do template strings) to do template strings. If you do that, anything inside of <code class=\"language-text\">${yourVariableHere}</code> gets output in the string. Cool, right?</p>\n<h3 id=\"booleans\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#booleans\" aria-label=\"booleans permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Booleans</h3>\n<p>Sometimes you just need a simple true or false. These are where booleans are useful. Something like a light switch's state is best represented by a boolean. A light is either on (true) or off (false). You'd have something like <code class=\"language-text\">const lightIsOn = true;</code>. Useful and you'll see them everywhere.</p>\n<h3 id=\"number\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#number\" aria-label=\"number permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Number</h3>\n<p>Some languages separate integers (whole numbers, like 1, 2, 3, 4, 500, 1000) and floats (1.2, 3.14159, 14.01, etc.) differently but not JavaScript. JavaScript just has one type of number, Number.

This is where <code class=\"language-text\">if</code> statements are very useful. Imagine if we tried this.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"javascript\"><pre class=\"language-javascript\"><code class=\"language-javascript\"><span class=\"token keyword\">const</span> skyIsBlue <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token boolean\">true</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n\n<span class=\"token keyword\">if</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>skyIsBlue<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n  console<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">log</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token string\">\"The sky is blue!\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">else</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n  console<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">log</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token string\">\"The sky is … not blue?\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>In the above example, the condition inside of the parens is evaluated and if it's true, the first block is run and the second is skipped. If it is false, the second block is run and the first block is skipped. Paste that code into your experiments and play with it. You also do not have to have an else block. Okay, let's go further.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"javascript\"><pre class=\"language-javascript\"><code class=\"language-javascript\"><span class=\"token keyword\">if</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token number\">2</span> <span class=\"token operator\">+</span> <span class=\"token number\">2</span> <span class=\"token operator\">===</span> <span class=\"token number\">4</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n  console<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">log</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>\n    <span class=\"token string\">\"Oh thank god, the fundamental principles of mathematics still hold true.\"</span>\n  <span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">else</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n  console<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">log</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token string\">\"Uh, panic?\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>You can put any expression (a technical terms, means anything you can stick on the right side of an equal sign, we'll explore it more as we go) inside of the if statement. In this case, we are asking, is two plus two still equal to four. If this is true (I hope so) then again the first block will be run. If not, the second will be.</p>\n<p>Let's talk about <code class=\"language-text\">===</code> for a second. If you use just one <code class=\"language-text\">=</code> in JavaScript, it means <strong>is assigned to</strong>. So when we have <code class=\"language-text\">const isBrianCool = true;</code> you can verbalize that as \"The variable isBrianCool is assigned to true\". Thus we can't use that inside of the if statement because that's not we mean. We're trying to ask a question, not assign something. We're trying to ask \"is two plus two equal to four.\" Enter the triple equals. Triple equals is the same as asking \"is this equal to that.\" We use the triple equals instead of the double equals because double equals does a lot of funny business that usually we don't want it to do. It does what's called coercion and we'll talk about that below. But in an example <code class=\"language-text\">2 == \"2\"</code> but it does not <code class=\"language-text\">2 === \"2\"</code>. String 2 is double equal to number 2 but string 2 is not triple equal to number 2.</p>\n<p>There's also <code class=\"language-text\">!==</code>. This is asking \"is this not equal to that\". Lastly you can ask with numbers <code class=\"language-text\">></code> <code class=\"language-text\">>=</code> <code class=\"language-text\">&lt;</code> <code class=\"language-text\">&lt;=</code> as well to ask if numbers less than or greater than too. For another example:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"javascript\"><pre class=\"language-javascript\"><code class=\"language-javascript\"><span class=\"token keyword\">const</span> friendsAtYourParty <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">10</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n\n<span class=\"token keyword\">if</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>friendsAtYourParty <span class=\"token operator\">===</span> <span class=\"token number\">0</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n  console<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">log</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token string\">\"Cool, now I have a lot of nachos to myself.\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">else</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">if</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>friendsAtYourParty <span class=\"token operator\">>=</span> <span class=\"token number\">4</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n  console<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">log</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token string\">\"Perfect amount to play some Mario Kart.\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">else</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n  console<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">log</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token string\">\"Wooooo turn on the dance music!\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>This also demonstrates the <code class=\"language-text\">else if</code> if you have more than just two different conditions.</p>\n<h3 id=\"loops\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#loops\" aria-label=\"loops permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Loops</h3>\n<p>Okay so now what if I want do one thing multiple times? I could do something like this</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"javascript\"><pre class=\"language-javascript\"><code class=\"language-javascript\"><span class=\"token keyword\">let</span> friendsAtYourParty <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">0</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\nfriendsAtYourParty <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> friendsAtYourParty <span class=\"token operator\">+</span> <span class=\"token number\">1</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\nfriendsAtYourParty <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> friendsAtYourParty <span class=\"token operator\">+</span> <span class=\"token number\">1</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\nfriendsAtYourParty <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> friendsAtYourParty <span class=\"token operator\">+</span> <span class=\"token number\">1</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\nfriendsAtYourParty <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> friendsAtYourParty <span class=\"token operator\">+</span> <span class=\"token number\">1</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\nfriendsAtYourParty <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> friendsAtYourParty <span class=\"token operator\">+</span> <span class=\"token number\">1</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\nfriendsAtYourParty <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> friendsAtYourParty <span class=\"token operator\">+</span> <span class=\"token number\">1</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\nfriendsAtYourParty <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> friendsAtYourParty <span class=\"token operator\">+</span> <span class=\"token number\">1</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\nfriendsAtYourParty <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> friendsAtYourParty <span class=\"token operator\">+</span> <span class=\"token number\">1</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\nfriendsAtYourParty <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> friendsAtYourParty <span class=\"token operator\">+</span> <span class=\"token number\">1</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\nfriendsAtYourParty <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> friendsAtYourParty <span class=\"token operator\">+</span> <span class=\"token number\">1</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\nconsole<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">log</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>friendsAtYourParty<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>That's annoying though. I wish there was a better way. Before we explore that, let's chat about this example a tad more.</p>\n<p>We used <code class=\"language-text\">let</code> instead of <code class=\"language-text\">const</code>. Things that are <code class=\"language-text\">const</code> cannot be reassigned later. In general I find this be of minor help but others do not so I leave you to make your own judgement call. In general one should try to follow the \"principle of least power.\" You should always choose the least powerful \"thing\" to accomplish whatever you're trying to do. Things with less power tend to be simpler and simple things are less prone to having or causing bugs. We instead use <code class=\"language-text\">let</code> here because you can see on the subsequent lines we do reassign <code class=\"language-text\">friendsAtYourParty</code> to be a different number. If you used <code class=\"language-text\">const</code> your code would crash because <code class=\"language-text\">const</code> won't let you do that. Thus here we use <code class=\"language-text\">let</code>. There's another one called <code class=\"language-text\">var</code> that is the old way of doing JavaScript. There are differences but I don't see a reason to use <code class=\"language-text\">var</code> at all anymore. It behaves more similar to <code class=\"language-text\">let</code>.</p>\n<p>Okay, so, we want to do this better, let's explore a few ways to do that using loops.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"javascript\"><pre class=\"language-javascript\"><code class=\"language-javascript\"><span class=\"token keyword\">let</span> friendsAtYourParty <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">0</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n<span class=\"token keyword\">while</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>friendsAtYourParty <span class=\"token operator\">&lt;</span> <span class=\"token number\">10</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n  friendsAtYourParty <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> friendsAtYourParty <span class=\"token operator\">+</span> <span class=\"token number\">1</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\nconsole<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">log</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>friendsAtYourParty<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>This is a while loop. The first part works similar to an <code class=\"language-text\">if</code> statement: as long as what's inside that statement is <strong>true</strong> it will continue running and re-running the body (what's between the <code class=\"language-text\">{ }</code>) until that statement is false. Once that statement is false, it'll break the loop and continue on. This case, we add 1 to <code class=\"language-text\">friendsAtYourParty</code> until it's 10, and then the next loop, when it's 10, it'll stop because 10 is not less than 10.</p>\n<p>Also, let's just show you a few shortcuts for adding one to a thing</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"javascript\"><pre class=\"language-javascript\"><code class=\"language-javascript\"><span class=\"token keyword\">let</span> friendsAtYourParty <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">0</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\nfriendsAtYourParty <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> friendsAtYourParty <span class=\"token operator\">+</span> <span class=\"token number\">1</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\nfriendsAtYourParty <span class=\"token operator\">+=</span> <span class=\"token number\">1</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\nfriendsAtYourParty<span class=\"token operator\">++</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n<span class=\"token operator\">++</span>friendsAtYourParty<span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\nconsole<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">log</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>friendsAtYourParty<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>Those four lines are equivalent. They all do the exact same thing: they add one to the existing total. The second one, the plus-equals line, you can put any number there and it'll add that amount to total, so <code class=\"language-text\">friendsAtYourParty += 15;</code> would add 15 to the total. It also works with <code class=\"language-text\">-=</code> (subtraction,) as well as <code class=\"language-text\">*=</code> (multiplication,) <code class=\"language-text\">/=</code> (division,) and <code class=\"language-text\">**=</code> (exponent.) Two last two lines (<code class=\"language-text\">++</code> before or after) just signify add one. They more-or-less mean the same thing (there's a subtle different of <em>when</em> it adds one that should never matter to you) but suffice to say everyone in the JavaScript community <em>always</em> does the <code class=\"language-text\">++</code> after; I've never seen anyone do it before in JavaScript.</p>\n<p>Okay, so now let's see a second kind of loop to achieve the same effect as above.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"javascript\"><pre class=\"language-javascript\"><code class=\"language-javascript\"><span class=\"token keyword\">let</span> friendsAtYourParty <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">0</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n<span class=\"token keyword\">for</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token keyword\">let</span> i <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">0</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span> i <span class=\"token operator\">&lt;=</span> <span class=\"token number\">10</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span> i<span class=\"token operator\">++</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n  friendsAtYourParty<span class=\"token operator\">++</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\nconsole<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">log</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>friendsAtYourParty<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>This is a for loop which is likely the most common kind of loop. Inside the parens are three statements and you need all of them. The <code class=\"language-text\">let i = 0;</code> is you defining your control variable that will control the loop. For some reason people always use <code class=\"language-text\">i</code>, not sure why. It's just that way. It really could be anything. The second statement <code class=\"language-text\">i &lt;= 10</code> is just like the while loop, is that's the statement that is as soon as it's false it breaks the loop. The last statement, <code class=\"language-text\">i++</code> is that happens at the end of every loop. In our case, we increment the control variable <code class=\"language-text\">i</code> so that it creeps closer to the end of the loop each time.</p>\n<p>An important note: in coding, we start counting from 0. In English, we count <code class=\"language-text\">1, 2, 3, 4, 5, etc.</code> but in coding we count <code class=\"language-text\">0, 1, 2, 3, 4, etc.</code>. So the fifth element of a string is index 4 (where index is how we'd refer to where that item is in the string). Index 0 is the first element. It's weird but you get used to it and it makes a lot of things easier.</p>\n<p>Sometimes, if you mess up what's inside the control condition for the loop, you'll get a runaway loop that'll never complete. This is called an <strong>infinite loop</strong> and it'll lock up and crash your code. Something like this:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"js\"><pre class=\"language-js\"><code class=\"language-js\"><span class=\"token keyword\">let</span> friendsAtYourParty <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">1</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n<span class=\"token keyword\">while</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>friendsAtYourParty <span class=\"token operator\">></span> <span class=\"token number\">0</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n  friendsAtYourParty <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> friendsAtYourParty <span class=\"token operator\">+</span> <span class=\"token number\">1</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\nconsole<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">log</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>friendsAtYourParty<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>Since you're adding one to <code class=\"language-text\">friendsAtYourParty</code> each time, and the loop will continue each time until it's less than zero, that condition will never happen. Thus it'll continue going until it crashes your code. Be careful of these. Nasty bugs.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exercise\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#exercise\" aria-label=\"exercise permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Exercise</h2>\n<p>You can use your console in your browser to see the output.
